unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_jav_cav_long	As the 12th century historian Gerald of Wales put it, the people of Welsh lands were ever-trained for war, from their leaders down to their peasantry. He described a people who, if the situation required it, would rush from their ploughs without hesitation to pick up weapons as quickly as the courtier from court. Their rough and hilly terrain resulted in earlier traditions of Celtic culture being reflected in more military terms – for example, a heavily armoured combatant such as a feudal horseman would have difficulty operating there, so Welsh warriors relied more on agility in war situations, rather than brute strength. Where rival armies who fought them relied on stubborn resistance, the Welsh relied on constant movement.\\n\\nIn broad terms, the organisation of Welsh troops was arranged between those in the essential household force known as the ‘teulu’, and the individuals of the expanded common army, the ‘llu’. Avoiding the open plains where they were at a disadvantage against heavier cavalry, they sometimes operated on horseback in a similar style to early Roman skirmishers. Unarmoured horsemen would ride without stirrups or a saddle on a smaller, more agile mare, equipped with up to three throwing spears, ready to hurl while mounted. These tactics were honed from the prevalence of hit-and-run cattle-raiding, since the main causes of conflict in Gael-dominated areas was loot. Although their techniques were primitive for the era, Gaelic warriors were still able to conquer large parts of Caledonia with the help of their skirmishing cavalry tactics.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_est_champions_long	In the centuries following the 8th century appearance of the first recorded Viking raiders in the Irish Sea, those of the Norse who chose to settle in the region came to be known as the ‘Ostmenn’, or more literally, ‘the men of the east’. This was how the settled Norse-Gaels contrasted themselves from the native Gaels, who they referred to as ‘Vestmen’, unsurprisingly, the 'men of the west’. Combining local traditions with their own, the Norse-Gaels were culturally distinct from both the Gaels and their Scandinavian forefathers. Their hybridisation of traditions took place against the setting of their coastal defensive strongholds, many of which were the nuclei of the powerful independent kingdoms of later years. Norse-Gaelic powerbases would eventually be established in places like Dublin, Galloway, and Mann, amongst other places.\\n\\nAs with many facets of their culture, the martial traditions of the Norse-Gaels retained both Viking and Gaelic elements. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long.

Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_earls_spearmen_long	As the kingdoms of Britain expanded, royal deputies were needed to deal with the routine business of the land on behalf of their kings. Such men were referred to as ealdormen in the early Saxon period, but by the 11th century the title was superseded by Scandinavian influence and they came to be referred to as earls and jarls, with the latter term used more in places more populated by Danes. An earl or jarl was not necessarily just a royal official, but could also be an upper-class man with land, estates, and a military retinue, likely by virtue of being descendant of a family that had previously ruled as kings, but subsequently had their lands absorbed into a larger kingdom.\\n\\nBeing well-to-do men, earls could fund the training and equipment for their own bands, so they were often made up of more elite soldiers than those who merely fought in the fyrds.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_nor_hirdmen_long	The Normans were one of the most successful and long-lived political and military cultures ever founded by the Vikings. Through military prowess and political manoeuvring in the 9th century, the Danish war leader Hrolf managed to secure a roughly autonomous region for his raiding army within the Frankish kingdom. Later going by the Frankish name Rollo, the Dane was given the status of duke, a position carried down his bloodline that ruled Normandy and subsequently conquered Norman lands. Their legendary expansionist successes were the result of a unique military structure within their fiefdoms, organised around a new type of warrior elite – the feudal knights. Supported by infantry, heavily armoured mounted lords would form fearsome cavalry blocks of around thirty men charging knee-to-knee, a psychologically imposing sight that often caused battle lines to break at their mere advance.\\n\\nUsing their system of infantry-supported knights, the Normans were incredibly effective in battle. Much like the Roman ‘comes’, in the Viking world there emerged a culture of heroic champions flanked by chosen companions. The ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank amongst such warriors, and in later times the rank carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on non-military aspects of government. In Old Norse and Old English, the term translates to ‘household man’, originally referring to an armed retinue for a warlord but eventually morphing into ‘housecarl’ or ‘huscarl’, specifically referring to a royal guard. Following the ninth-century Danish settlement of England, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_jav_cav_long	The Middle Irish word ‘ceithern’, pronounced ‘kern’, refers to a group of fighters who were one of two essential components of medieval Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, the role of a kern was to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles they filled very much depended on the needs of their clan, which did not exclude them from the cut and thrust of melee warfare. Kerns would frequently be the first or last to launch attacks – their mobility meant that they were well-suited to initiate swift ambushes, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, while later in battles they could also easily run down any fleeing routers.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, kerns wore a light leather coat which ensured unrestricted movement and agility. Avoiding the open plains where they were at a disadvantage against heavier cavalry, they sometimes operated on horseback in a similar style to early Roman skirmishers. Unarmoured horsemen would ride without stirrups or a saddle on a smaller, more agile mare, equipped with up to three throwing spears, ready to hurl while mounted.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_dan_mailed_swordsmen_long	The warriors of the Danelaw were part of the powerful Danish military aristocracy that dominated the areas of Britain in which the Vikings settled during the 9th century. There had been several confrontations between the fyrds of King Alfred the Great and Danish forces up until then, culminating in the agreement which saw the Danish warlord Guthrum withdraw his forces from Wessex in the autumn of AD 877. In doing so, a portion of his Great Heathen Army settled down in the eastern part of Mercia, laying the origins of the Danelaw, the region where distinctively Danish laws held prominence in the local courts. Legal traditions aside, Danish military customs were also well entrenched in the area as Guthrum, initially unsatisfied with his army’s unfulfillments, remained poised for potential renewed attacks on Wessex.\\n\\nThe settled Danes shared out the land for the purposes of agricultural subsistence, but still retained their strong Scandinavian warrior traditions. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_catapult_long	The onset of the Dark Ages saw the glory days of Greco-Roman-era siege engines come to an abrupt end. The catapult, named after the Greek word ‘katapultos’ meaning ‘shield piercer’, was one such siege weapon used to great effect by groups in antiquity. Having been so successful for the Roman Empire, numerous European war leaders of the early medieval period attempted to imitate the technology of one genus of Roman catapults called onagers. They originally took the form of large, torsion-powered missile throwers made entirely of wood, sat upon a kind of chassis supporting an ‘arm’ with a sling attached to it. Rotational forces would be harnessed into strands of thick, sinewy, coiled rope using a winch and ratchet, then the throwing arm was pulled back using a windlass and considerable brute strength, which was then secured in place as close to ground level as possible with a slip hook. The cocked arm held an incredible amount of potential energy and could be loaded with a payload – usually large rocks – waiting to be released and launched over vast distances.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the high-maintenance catapults of the early Middle Ages were troublesome machines and far inferior to those seen in antiquity, with the revived technology not able to match the strength, resilience, or accuracy of the onagers of the distant past. In time, however, medieval siege techniques eventually surpassed their forebears with the development of the 12th century European trebuchet, using technology thought to be similar to that used in China over a millennium earlier.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_ceorl_spearmen_long	An individual known as a ‘ceorl’ or ‘churl’ had a very particular place in the stratified society of Anglo-Saxon England. Forming the basis of the free populace, they were neither noblemen nor slaves, ranking above the servile classes but below the nobility. A ceorl’s free status was marked by several factors, such as his attendance at local courts, his payment of dues directly to his lord or king, and perhaps most notably for the era, his right to bear arms. In fact, since many ceorls would have been tenants or even landowners, under Anglo-Saxon law they would have been liable for military duty in the fyrd, as was the case in Wessex.\\n\\nBeing freemen, ceorls would have had to provide their own weaponry. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence. Given its comparative cheapness and ease of construction, the spear was one of the most commonly used weapons among all classes of fighting men before and throughout medieval times.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_airig_horsemen_long	The Irish kings of the Dark Ages were rulers of men rather than territory, which provided the basis for the development of Ireland’s tiered social order. At the top stood a High King who most regional rulers answered to, while at the bottom languished a large, unfree peasantry. Many Irish records of the early medieval period mention the word ‘aire’ to refer to those in between; a catch-all term describing anyone who held an independent legal status. Written laws dating to later centuries, however, use the word ‘airig’ more specifically in references to nobles or chiefs, distinguishing them from commoners. Indeed, Ireland’s sumptuary laws of the 7th and 8th centuries even refer to the colours that each social class were allowed to wear, including those for the Airig nobility – grey, brown, or red.\\n\\nCommanding a ‘cet’ – a military unit of up to one hundred men – the Airig nobility were high-ranking combatants. Their use of spears from horseback had been seen in a similar form around Britain before, with the Roman use of lance-bearing cavalry regiments. Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable. Stirrups ensured stability, so what had formerly been impossible on horseback in the cut and thrust of battle then became easy.	true

The throwing spear or javelin was one such genus of weapons they used, with the thrusting variety not always entirely distinct from the thrown variety. The advantage of the javelin thrower was the ability to potentially pierce through shields and armour from distance, but this was offset by the reduced range and limited output compared to standard archers, since there were only so many javelins a thrower could carry at any one time. Javelin throwing was certainly a unique skill, with the most skilful Viking warriors allegedly even able to catch spears in mid-flight to hurl them straight back!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_schiltron_long	A schiltron was a defensive pike formation used to great effect by Scottish foot soldiers against heavy cavalry in several encounters throughout medieval history. It is thought that the term itself dates back to the 10th century from the Old English word ‘scildtruma’ meaning a type of mobile phalanx or testudo. It was very similar in nature to both, consisting of long, heavy spears held at increasing angles by several rows of men, protected by wooden spikes embedded in the ground at the front of the line. With well-drilled movements, the schiltron was a fairly mobile entity that could quickly deploy in a splayed array which only the foolhardiest of horsemen would dare charge – indeed, most horses would downright refuse to go near it.\\n\\nSchiltron tactics were likely used for centuries from early medieval times, but a refinement of strategies led to historians deeming it notable enough to be mentioned as having been used in the Battle of Falkirk against the English at the end of the thirteenth century, albeit unsuccessfully. More notably, when the Scots faced the English once again a few years later in the Battle of Bannockburn, the vastly greater numbers of the English bolstered with heavy cavalry were gloriously defeated at the ends of Scottish pikes. Although early versions of the pikes used in schiltrons may have simply been long cylinders of wood carved into a point, later versions were much more sturdy, with pointed iron crossheads pinned onto a shaft of hardwood, cut in lengths of up to fifteen feet.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_caterans_long	The name ‘cateran’ comes from the Gaelic word ‘ceathairne’, used to refer to a band of armed peasants from the Scottish Highlands. Literally, the word means ‘battle man’ – a warrior. Specifically employed by a warlord as a private fighting force to harass neighbouring clans, over time the cateran became professional soldiers, rather than simply low-born men pressed into the service of their local lord on a part-time basis. By the beginning of the Middle Ages the word cateran had fallen out of use, only being used to describe bandits, marauders and cattle-thieves at that point in time. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups. Axes granted a unique form of damage output – although swords were ideal for slashing and stabbing, an axe could hack and chop with relatively less effort, and in the right hands was particularly useful for piercing armour, decapitation, and dismemberment.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_javelins_long	For many, the word ‘Viking’ conjures up scenes of pillaging marauders from across the sea, rampaging around the coastlines of Britain in the last centuries leading up to the Norman conquest. However, the Vikings should not simply be thought of as mindless, bloodthirsty looters, and instead should be seen for what they really were – initially, sea-based raiders from Scandinavia who would avoid a fight if it meant a quick profit, and later on, migrants in search of newer pastures to settle in, from which they could subsist and even trade. Indeed, the earliest Viking forays into Britain were quick raids of lightly defended, but highly bountiful targets such as churches and monasteries, while in later years they concentrated their actions on conquering lands to establish themselves as permanent kings.\\n\\nThe Vikings were rightly known for their skill at war, utilising the traditional barbarian charge alongside carefully drilled shield wall tactics.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_dan_anglian_champions_long	From the earliest times of the Danelaw, a number of fortified Saxon towns known as burhs were assigned their own Danish armies, where the most learned warriors practised martial traditions that were both Saxon and Dane. By the time of the beginnings of Danish rule in England, it had been 450 years since the initial Anglian settlement in the east, during which the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia was formed. The Northmen had attacked the region several times, but from around AD 870 following the defeat and martyring of King Edmund, they overran the entire East Anglian kingdom with the intention to stay permanently. With this large-scale settlement there was much synthesis between the traditions and customs of the Vikings and that of the Saxons, which, to some extent, were already culturally similar. As a testament to this, Danish huscarls became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings. Undoubtedly such dedication was born out of a tradition of champions that were initially uniquely East Anglian, or more broadly, ‘Danish-Saxon’.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_thegn_spearmen_long	During the era of Viking settlement in Britain, an integral part of the fyrds was a class of noblemen-warriors who owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. They were known as thegns, who in the earliest times of Saxon migration were exclusively defined by that military service. The first Anglo-Saxon leaders kept ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some thegns fought for their conquerors in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.\\n\\nThegns were much better equipped for war than most other troops. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence. Given its comparative cheapness and ease of construction, the spear was one of the most commonly used weapons among all classes of fighting men before and throughout medieval times.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_raider_swordsmen_long	Surviving on the edge of the Roman world for centuries, early medieval Ireland was a militarily primitive place, with archaeological evidence showing that Irish war equipment was inferior to that of other Europeans. Being a people of martial character, the Irish nevertheless engaged in warfare and raids more as an aristocratic pastime than a matter of survival. Raiding between the various groups within Ireland for the purposes of loot was commonplace and frequently the reason to take up arms, with the theft of cattle often the cause of bigger conflicts. The Irish were also known to have been raiding western Britain prior to the end of Roman rule, long before the Vikings had even been seen there, with slaves being the most lucrative form of booty.\\n\\nThe swiftness of Irish raiders was their greatest strength, with most fighting as unarmoured infantry wielding older, more traditional weapons. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands.

Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_earls_horsemen_long	As the kingdoms of Britain expanded, royal deputies were needed to deal with the routine business of the land on behalf of their kings. Such men were referred to as ealdormen in the early Saxon period, but by the 11th century the title was superseded by Scandinavian influence and they came to be referred to as earls and jarls, with the latter term used more in places more populated by Danes. An earl or jarl was not necessarily just a royal official, but could also be an upper-class man with land, estates, and a military retinue, likely by virtue of being descendant of a family that had previously ruled as kings, but subsequently had their lands absorbed into a larger kingdom.\\n\\nBeing well-to-do men, earls could fund the training and equipment for their own bands, so they were often made up of more elite soldiers than those who merely fought in the fyrds.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_gen_royal_companion_bodyguard_long	In the years following the departure of the Romans from Britain, many communities had to organise their headship – at least in part – for the purposes of war. In many places, the constant threat of invasion or absorption by hostile expanding neighbours meant that the links between social organisation and martial organisation were close and integral, which was reflected in the hierarchy. Every social or family group had to look to their own security to defend their rights and interests, and it was no different for the ruling elite. The function of kings and chiefs was, above all, to provide war leadership. In many parts of Britain, leaders of tribal descent used loyalty systems which granted the best warriors the greatest rewards when in service of their households as companions or bodyguards, which extended onto the battlefield. A similar system existed in Celtic Ireland and Scotland, where martial leaders presided over small and ever-changing kingdoms alongside nobles and royal followers who fought in their direct service. The Welsh, although less influenced by feudalism, also operated under similar systems of the ‘teulu’ – the individual princes’ and chieftains’ personal bodyguards – who typically went to war alongside larger numbers of freemen who made up the bulk of the armies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_thegn_horsemen_long	During the era of Viking settlement in Britain, an integral part of the fyrds was a class of noblemen-warriors who owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. They were known as thegns, who in the earliest times of Saxon migration were exclusively defined by that military service. The first Anglo-Saxon leaders kept ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some thegns fought for their conquerors in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.\\n\\nThegns were much better equipped for war than most other troops.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_fyrd_javelinmen_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_marcher_spearmen_long	The border area between England and Wales has long been decisive in the course of British history. In early medieval England, a ‘marcher’ was a soldier appointed to guard the Welsh Marches, the name used to refer to the imprecise areas of demarcation between lands of Mercia and those of the Welsh kingdoms. Mercia often had a tumultuous relationship with its neighbours to the west, as attested by the construction of Offa’s Dyke during his reign in the latter half of the 9th century. Extending for just over 60 miles, the main purpose for the earthworks was to reinforce a frontier with the newly resurgent Welsh kingdom of Powys. The Dyke was likely to have seen frequent small-scale scuffles between the Mercian guards and unsavoury groups such as cattle rustlers and opportunistic raiding parties.\\n\\nThe marchers sent to guard Offa’s Dyke also had to be capable enough to repel attacks from bona fide warriors.

Later going by the Frankish name Rollo, the Dane was given the status of duke, a position carried down his bloodline that ruled Normandy and subsequently conquered Norman lands. Their legendary expansionist successes were the result of a unique military structure within their fiefdoms, organised around a new type of warrior elite – the feudal knights.

Referred to as the fianna, they were made up of individuals who had chosen the life as an alternative to languishing in the social limbo of not having received land of their own in the form of inheritance, endowment, or dowry, so had decided to prove their mettle in other ways. Often of aristocratic birth, they survived by camping, hunting, fishing, and foraging, but life in the wilderness was not always so straightforward. Members of the fianna were quickly hardened by the necessities of survival, sometimes raiding and pillaging nearby territories which were unaligned or hostile with their own tuath. To their own people, they were considered a ready source of mobile fighters that could quickly be called upon in the event of enemy raids or invasions.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_thegns_long	During the era of Viking settlement in Britain, an integral part of the fyrds was a class of noblemen-warriors who owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. They were known as thegns, who in the earliest times of Saxon migration were exclusively defined by that military service. The first Anglo-Saxon leaders kept ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some thegns fought for their conquerors in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.\\n\\nThegns were much better equipped for war than most other troops. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long. Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true

Ancestors of the modern Irish Wolf Hound, they were truly giant dogs allegedly capable of ripping a man's head off, and even dragging him right off his horse or chariot to maul him to death. It is thought that the modern name ‘Wolf Hound’ was not given to them by virtue of their similarities in appearance to wolves – although they may have had similar coloured coats to grey wolves, and easily matched them in stature – but rather for their effective use in hunting and killing them, such was their power and size. The Celts’ war dogs were even mentioned by Julius Caesar in his treatise ‘The Gallic Wars’, with the Romans referring to them as ‘canes Scots’, differentiating them from the ancient Rottweiler-like molossus used by the Greeks and Romans in battle. They also heavily feature in Irish mythology and were revered on the island, appearing on the coat of arms of several early Irish Kings, and known to have typically been owned by nobility for guarding property and herds as well as for war.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_dane_axes_long	For many, the word ‘Viking’ conjures up scenes of pillaging marauders from across the sea, rampaging around the coastlines of Britain in the last centuries leading up to the Norman conquest. However, the Vikings should not simply be thought of as mindless, bloodthirsty looters, and instead should be seen for what they really were – initially, sea-based raiders from Scandinavia who would avoid a fight if it meant a quick profit, and later on, migrants in search of newer pastures to settle in, from which they could subsist and even trade. Indeed, the earliest Viking forays into Britain were quick raids of lightly defended, but highly bountiful targets such as churches and monasteries, while in later years they concentrated their actions on conquering lands to establish themselves as permanent kings.\\n\\nThe Vikings were rightly known for their skill at war, utilising the traditional barbarian charge alongside carefully drilled shield wall tactics.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_transport	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where ships could go. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_valley_spearmen_long	In modern times, references to ‘The Valleys’ of Wales are mostly associated with the industrialised regions in the south of the country, but in historical accounts dating back to the early Middle Ages, the ‘Valley Spearmen’ of Wales refers to a tradition of Welsh warriors which originated in the north. All infantry of medieval Welsh armies were known for their agility and aptitude in operating in the rough and hilly terrain of their homelands, and while the men of the south were renowned for their prowess with the Welsh longbow, the regions around the historical northern county of Merionethshire were known for their tough spearmen. Often dressed in red linen shirts and long woollen cloaks, they were depicted as having worn only one shoe with one foot kept bare, likely as a way to keep their balance in their hilly landscape. They were particularly effective on marshy or broken ground, which always favoured them against heavy cavalry or heavily-armoured infantry. The lightly-armoured Welsh spearmen were well-drilled in the use of phalanxes and long pikes, but as much as their agility in their own landscape was a considerable advantage, without it they were often at risk of being overrun by better-equipped opposition, as was the case during their crushing 13th century defeats at the hands of the English under Edward I.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_mormaer_horsemen_long	The regional lords of early medieval Scotland known as the ‘Mormaers’ were awarded the title as individuals positioned directly beneath the king within the structure of Highland society. Initially they were the rulers of any one of the seven provinces which made up the area of Celtic Scotland north of the Forth and Clyde, but eventually became the group of nobles who oversaw the defence of the Scottish coast from the Nordic raids which occurred after the Picts had been supplanted as the largest tribal group in north Britannia. Although the title is Celtic in origin, later Viking influence rendered it ‘Jarl’ and eventually under Anglo-Norman influence, ‘Earl’.\\n\\nLike many other nobles of the period, the Mormaers fought as cavalry on the battlefield. Their use of spears from horseback had been seen in a similar form around Britain before, with the Roman use of lance-bearing cavalry regiments. Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable. Stirrups ensured stability, so that what had formerly been impossible on horseback in the cut and thrust of battle then became easy.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_hus_dane_axes_long	Much like the Roman ‘comes’, in the Viking world there emerged a culture of heroic champions flanked by chosen companions. The ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank amongst such warriors, and in later times the rank carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on non-military aspects of government. In Old Norse and Old English, the term translates to ‘household man’, originally referring to an armed retinue for a warlord but eventually morphing into ‘housecarl’ or ‘huscarl’, specifically referring to a royal guard. Following the 9th century Danish settlement of England, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings.\\n\\nHirdmen and huscarls were undoubtedly warriors of elite status, reflected in their superior weaponry and armour.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_fyrd_spearmen_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_berserkers_long	Howling like animals at their enemies across the battlefield, the Berserkers of Viking armies often took on the semblance of wild animals, entering battles in an almost trance-like state. They would work themselves into a frenzy so intense, it is said they bit on the edges of their shields and could even ignore the pain of wounds. Their apparently feral appearance is alluded to in the Old Norse etymology of their name – ‘ber’ meaning bear, and ‘serkr’ roughly translating to shirt, thus literally, ‘a bear-skinned warrior’. Indeed, they had little protection other than the skins they wore, and were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade, or any blow that came their way. The roots of this mentality came from the old Norse religions, in which many warriors clung to the belief that Odin, the God of War, gave them both protection and superhuman powers, so that they would have no need of armour. To encounter these enraged warriors on the battlefield was to face crazed men who were defying the standard logistics of battle at the time – it is no wonder that some who did so and lived to tell the tale thought them to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_freemen_axes_long	The freemen living within the social orders of the early medieval period generally existed as a group between the nobles above them and the slave classes below. Freemen possessed the most social mobility of all classes – for example, they could accumulate followers as a result of battle exploits, or even more simply from their generosity or camaraderie with others. Accumulation of wealth earned by amassing battle loot or simply through success in a trade was also possible, but in any case, accumulating enough of either followers or riches could elevate a freeman into nobility. Equally, accumulation of debts that couldn't be repaid would mean a freeman could easily become a bondsman, working as a slave to pay off his debt or even fighting as a serf levy for another man until his debt was considered no more.\\n\\nAbove all, freemen were free to fight. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_wood_kerns_long	Existing on the fringes of Roman-ruled Britain, early medieval Ireland was by no means a lawless place. However, native Gaels who by some sequence of events ended up landless and not tied to a lord – particularly those with an aptitude for fighting – sometimes ended up living as outlaws in the mountains and woods. Such combatants were known as ‘widcairns’ or wood kerns, and were feared and hated by sedentary peoples in equal measure. Using their terrain and knowledge of swift ambush tactics, they were formidable fighters who took what they needed from those unfortunate enough to venture into their woodland territories. They operated under the leadership of fiery spirits among the youthful gentry and former nobility of Ireland, pushed to the edges of society with resentments and bravado that made them Robin Hood figures to their followers.\\n\\nWith no lands of their own, wood kerns fought and lived solely for plunder. The throwing spear or javelin was one such genus of weapons they used, with the thrusting variety not always entirely distinct from the thrown variety. The advantage of the javelin thrower was the ability to potentially pierce through shields and armour from distance, but this was offset by the reduced range and limited output compared to standard archers, since there were only so many javelins a thrower could carry at any one time.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_axe_hersir_long	When the Vikings first set out to pillage the coasts of Europe in the 8th century, those who led the raiding parties were not kings, earls, or jarls, but a lesser rank of war leaders known as hersirs. They were superior warriors who commanded small bands of men, organising them into the shield walls used to defeat the armies that opposed their early incursions into places like Britain. In the Norse context, a hersir was typically an independent landowner or chieftain, but by the tenth century their role had changed into something much less autonomous with many becoming regional military servants of Scandinavian kings and nobles. Many also still gave their military services to earls and jarls as battlefield companions, making them the rough equivalent to the huscarls of the late Anglo-Saxon period.\\n\\nBeing military commanders, hersirs typically donned superior equipment to the men they led on their raids. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups. Axes granted a unique form of damage output – although swords were ideal for slashing and stabbing, an axe could hack and chop with relatively less effort, and in the right hands was particularly useful for piercing armour, decapitation, and dismemberment.	true

In doing so, a portion of his Great Heathen Army settled down in the eastern part of Mercia, laying the origins of the Danelaw, the region where distinctively Danish laws held prominence in the local courts.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_highland_bows_long	The early medieval Highlanders of Alba were a cultural mix of Gaelic, Celtic, and other peoples, who had much in common with similar groups in nearby Ireland and northern Britain. Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women. Their climate made them particularly tough, readily fighting into the depth of winter when required. Even the Vikings were fearful of the Highlanders of northern Britain by their own accounts – the classic Icelandic saga ‘Islendingasagur’ warns other Norsemen to approach parts of the Scottish coast with caution, lest it cost them their lives!\\n\\nThe warriors of Alba were generally made up of territorial units of fighting men. Although archery wasn't considered the most ‘warrior-like’ of practices, it was still a specialisation chosen by some for the purposes of war. The prevalence of hunting and the past presence of stationed Roman archers around Britain meant that it was by no means an unknown discipline, with archer regiment tactics varying between the warring groups of the day.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_freemen_javelinmen_long	The freemen living within the social orders of the early medieval period generally existed as a group between the nobles above them and the slave classes below. Freemen possessed the most social mobility of all classes – for example, they could accumulate followers as a result of battle exploits, or even more simply from their generosity or camaraderie with others. Accumulation of wealth earned by amassing battle loot or simply through success in a trade was also possible, but in any case, accumulating enough of either followers or riches could elevate a freeman into nobility. Equally, accumulation of debts that couldn't be repaid would mean a freeman could easily become a bondsman, working as a slave to pay off his debt or even fighting as a serf levy for another man until his debt was considered no more.\\n\\nAbove all, freemen were free to fight. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence. Given its comparative cheapness and ease of construction, the spear was one of the most commonly used weapons among all classes of fighting men before and throughout medieval times. Its notable advantage was the longer reach it afforded its bearer, enabling effective engagement with a larger or mounted enemy who might otherwise be out of reach. The Viking tendency to emblazon spears with ostentatious decorative carvings indicates that some were primarily used for thrusting rather than throwing, reducing the possibility of losing what were obviously prized weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_kern_axemen_long	The Middle Irish word ‘ceithern’, pronounced ‘kern’, refers to a group of fighters who were one of two essential components of medieval Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, the role of a kern was to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles they filled very much depended on the needs of their clan, which did not exclude them from the cut and thrust of melee warfare. Kerns would frequently be the first or last to launch attacks – their mobility meant that they were well-suited to initiate swift ambushes, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, while later in battles they could also easily run down any fleeing routers.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, kerns wore a light leather coat which ensured unrestricted movement and agility. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_seaxs_long	The Saxons were not only warriors by nature, but also by name. The term ‘Saxon’ was thought to have been used by the Romans to describe the West Germanic tribe from which the Anglo-Saxons descended – the ‘Seaxe’ in Old English, also simply meaning ‘knife’. By extension, Saxon quite literally means ‘warrior with knives’. In practical terms, the seax was a sidearm that could be used as a domestic tool or as a backup to a main weapon, but there were certainly those who used them as a central means of self-defence. The use of supplementary dagger-type weapons was not limited to the Saxons, with Scandinavian groups of the 4th and 5th centuries carrying similar single-edged knives, and even the smaller Hunnic sabre was thought to be an ancestor of the weapon. Even so, the seax was widespread enough amongst the Saxons in particular for the term to be used by others to differentiate them from other tribes. To the Saxons themselves, the seax likely had symbolic connotations relating to a person’s status. For example, carrying one may have marked out an individual as a hunter, or perhaps even signified the broader group of all Saxon freemen, since slaves were not allowed to bear arms.	true

He described a people who, if the situation required it, would rush from their ploughs without hesitation to pick up weapons as quickly as the courtier from court. Their rough and hilly terrain resulted in earlier traditions of Celtic culture being reflected in more military terms – for example, a heavily armoured combatant such as a feudal horseman would have difficulty operating there, so Welsh warriors relied more on agility in war situations, rather than brute strength. Where rival armies who fought them relied on stubborn resistance, the Welsh relied on constant movement.\\n\\nIn broad terms, the organisation of Welsh troops was arranged between those in the essential household force known as the ‘teulu’, and the individuals of the expanded common army, the ‘llu’.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_bows_long	Long before the prominence of archers as staple regiments in the English army during the Hundred Years' War, there had already been an extensive tradition of archery in Wales. The historical record relates that in AD 633, five centuries before its earliest known use by the English, a Welsh longbow was used to kill Prince Edwin of Northumbria in a confrontation with the army of King Cadwallon of Gwined. Early Welsh bows were constructed from wych elm, as opposed to yew or horn used in the English adaptations which came later, and designed not for distance but to inflict severe wounds in close quarters. This was suited to a landscape in which the main fighting tactic was a quick charge followed by a feigned retreat into the woods, with the intention being to trap pursuers in a lethal short-range ambush.\\n\\nWelsh longbows required considerable training to operate, but were far more powerful than any other ranged weapons of the era. As the historian Gerald of Wales put it, their arrows could penetrate ‘a hand’s width into an oak door’, ‘through a man’s armour and thigh, into his horse’, and ‘through an armoured horseman’s hip into his saddle’. The aptitude of the Welsh archers in ranged warfare was also reflected by the obvious difficulty in mastering the later longbows they became known for. They were highly unwieldy weapons, bulky but capable of a draw-weight exceeding 50 kg. In fact, archaeological finds of skeletons belonging to longbow archers almost always show recognisable deformations, with enlarged arms and bone spurs commonly seen on the wrists, shoulders, and fingers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_fyrd_archers_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods. Although archery wasn't considered the most ‘warrior-like’ of practices, it was still a specialisation chosen by some for the purposes of war.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_dan_northumbrian_thegns_long	The cultural synthesis between Vikings and Saxons that took place in locations like Northumbria affected several facets of Anglo-Saxon life, not least their military practices. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle remarks that in AD 876 the Danish war leader Halfdan led his retinue of warriors away from the Great Army and returned to Northumbria, where it is recorded that he then divided up the land there so that his people could ‘plough and support themselves’. Indeed, the eventual Viking settlement of northern England soon saw one particularly integral part of Anglo-Saxon army traditions adopted by the newly settled Vikings – the recognition of the thegns, a class of noblemen-warriors who had owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. In the earliest times of Saxon migration, the thegns were exclusively defined by that military service, with the first Anglo-Saxon leaders keeping ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, however, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ to Saxon kings, with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some Saxon thegns fought for their conquerors, in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_earls_thegns_long	As the kingdoms of Britain expanded, royal deputies were needed to deal with the routine business of the land on behalf of their kings. Such men were referred to as ealdormen in the early Saxon period, but by the 11th century the title was superseded by Scandinavian influence and they came to be referred to as earls and jarls, with the latter term used more in places more populated by Danes. An earl or jarl was not necessarily just a royal official, but could also be an upper-class man with land, estates, and a military retinue, likely by virtue of being descendant of a family that had previously ruled as kings, but subsequently had their lands absorbed into a larger kingdom.\\n\\nBeing well-to-do men, earls could fund the training and equipment for their own bands, so they were often made up of more elite soldiers than those who merely fought in the fyrds. Militarily, their thegns were their most important servants.

Being a people of martial character, the Irish nevertheless engaged in warfare and raids more as an aristocratic pastime than a matter of survival. Raiding between the various groups within Ireland for the purposes of loot was commonplace and frequently the reason to take up arms, with the theft of cattle often the cause of bigger conflicts. The Irish were also known to have been raiding western Britain prior to the end of Roman rule, long before the Vikings had even been seen there, with slaves being the most lucrative form of booty.\\n\\nThe swiftness of Irish raiders was their greatest strength, with most fighting as unarmoured infantry wielding older, more traditional weapons.

The systems which existed in Celtic Ireland and Scotland were ones in which martial leaders presided over small and ever-changing kingdoms alongside nobles and royal followers who fought in their direct service. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in north western Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long. Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true

Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_gen_warlords_hearthguard_long	A ‘hearthweru’ or hearthguard was, more often than not, a personal friend of a warlord or king who would readily offer his sword in protection on the battlefield in return for gifts, lands, and power. The image of a leader being a generous donor of valuables to his most loyal companions was a running theme throughout the early Middle Ages, and this was certainly the case for the raiding Vikings and the settled Norse kings in Britain and Ireland. In the Viking context, wealth in the form of loot would have certainly appealed to a young warrior of the hearthguard and was often the primary motivation to serve a great war leader, but so was the chance to stake a claim to newly settled lands. The acquisition of land or wealth was not always the sole factor that sustained a hearthguard’s relationship with a warlord or king, however. The very name 'hearth' friend or companion implies closeness to the man served, eating and sharing his company around the fire, through which great bonds of friendship and loyalty were made. When not at war, hearth companions were the closest thing to a loyal professional militia, dispensing their lord’s will and authority on his behalf.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_black_blades_long	The early medieval Highlanders of Alba were a cultural mix of Gaelic, Celtic, and other peoples, who had much in common with similar groups in nearby Ireland and northern Britain. Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women. Their climate made them particularly tough, readily fighting into the depth of winter when required. Even the Vikings were fearful of the Highlanders of northern Britain by their own accounts – the classic Icelandic saga ‘Islendingasagur’ warns other Norsemen to approach parts of the Scottish coast with caution, lest it cost them their lives!\\n\\nThe warriors of Alba were generally made up of territorial units of fighting men. Historical accounts indicate that when some of their forces fought, they often wielded weapons that were very dark in colour. This must have been particularly alien to foreign attackers, when even a second's hesitation on the battlefield could mean the difference between life and death. Tales from the time speak of warriors with black swords, indicating that blades may have been left unpolished to help with waterproofing against the British weather. This initially unforeseen effect on invaders was soon turned to an advantage by the wily Scots, who capitalised on their ferocious appearance, in combination with the element of surprise, to defeat their opponents.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_horse_boys_long	Surviving on the edge of the Roman world for centuries, early medieval Ireland was a militarily primitive place, with archaeological evidence showing that Irish war equipment was inferior to that of other Europeans. Being a people of martial character, the Irish nevertheless engaged in warfare and raids more as an aristocratic pastime than a matter of survival. Raiding between the various groups within Ireland for the purposes of loot was commonplace and frequently the reason to take up arms, with the theft of cattle often the cause of bigger conflicts. The Irish were also known to have been raiding western Britain prior to the end of Roman rule, long before the Vikings had even been seen there, with slaves being the most lucrative form of booty.\\n\\nThe swiftness of Irish raiders was their greatest strength, with most fighting as unarmoured infantry wielding older, more traditional weapons. Avoiding the open plains where they were at a disadvantage against heavier cavalry, they sometimes operated on horseback in a similar style to early Roman skirmishers. Unarmoured horsemen would ride without stirrups or a saddle on a smaller, more agile mare, equipped with up to three throwing spears, ready to hurl while mounted. These tactics were honed from the prevalence of hit-and-run cattle-raiding, since the main causes of conflict in Gael-dominated areas was loot. Although their techniques were primitive for the era, Gaelic warriors were still able to conquer large parts of Caledonia with the help of their skirmishing cavalry tactics.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_sword_hirdmen_long	Much like the Roman ‘comes’, in the Viking world there emerged a culture of heroic champions flanked by chosen companions. The ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank amongst such warriors, and in later times the rank carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on non-military aspects of government. In Old Norse and Old English, the term translates to ‘household man’, originally referring to an armed retinue for a warlord but eventually morphing into ‘housecarl’ or ‘huscarl’, specifically referring to a royal guard. Following the 9th century Danish settlement of England, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings.\\n\\nHirdmen and huscarls were undoubtedly warriors of elite status, reflected in their superior weaponry and armour. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long. Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_fyrd_axemen_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups. Axes granted a unique form of damage output – although swords were ideal for slashing and stabbing, an axe could hack and chop with relatively less effort, and in the right hands was particularly useful for piercing armour, decapitation, and dismemberment.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_crossbowmen_long	Thought to have been invented simultaneously in both Greece and China during the 5th century BC, various forms of crossbow had been spreading rapidly across Europe from well before the Migration Period. By the turn of millennium into the Common Era, the Romans had already fielded their large torsion-sprung scorpion and ballista bolt throwers for the first time, and by the second century were training cavalry to use handheld adaptations on the battlefield. Eventually, the crossbow reached the barbarian tribal confederations of northern and western Europe, where it was used in deadly combination with the pike tactics emerging at the time, while also becoming a popular hunting weapon.\\n\\nThe crossbow originally came about as a way of automating the simple bow. It worked by mounting a shorter arrow or bolt horizontally on a barrel or stock that, once fitted, could be drawn with a ratchet mechanism to a much greater tension than a man alone could generate without one. This meant that the crossbow could penetrate heavy armour far more effectively than ever before. Also, unlike the bow which took many years of training and practice to master, a layman could be taught to use a crossbow in well within a week. Comparably poor rates of fire was the weapon’s only real downside, but since it could be held in tension for a much longer period of time, crossbowmen often had time to pick and choose their shots carefully. This aspect meant that crossbows were unequalled as the sniper rifles of the ancient and medieval worlds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_hersir_spears_long	When the Vikings first set out to pillage the coasts of Europe in the 8th century, those who led the raiding parties were not kings, earls, or jarls, but a lesser rank of war leaders known as hersirs. They were superior warriors who commanded small bands of men, organising them into the shield walls used to defeat the armies that opposed their early incursions into places like Britain. In the Norse context, a hersir was typically an independent landowner or chieftain, but by the tenth century their role had changed into something much less autonomous with many becoming regional military servants of Scandinavian kings and nobles. Many also still gave their military services to earls and jarls as battlefield companions, making them the rough equivalent to the huscarls of the late Anglo-Saxon period.\\n\\nBeing military commanders, hersirs typically donned superior equipment to the men they led on their raids. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence. Given its comparative cheapness and ease of construction, the spear was one of the most commonly used weapons among all classes of fighting men before and throughout medieval times. Its notable advantage was the longer reach it afforded its bearer, enabling effective engagement with a larger or mounted enemy who might otherwise be out of reach. The Viking tendency to emblazon spears with ostentatious decorative carvings indicates that some were primarily used for thrusting rather than throwing, reducing the possibility of losing what were obviously prized weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_jomsvikings_long	According to the 13th century Icelandic Sagas, in the early Middle Ages there existed a fearless warrior-brotherhood of legendary Viking mercenaries, known as the 'Jomsvikings'. Always described as men of unequalled bravery and martial skill, they based themselves in a fortress on the southern Baltic shore in place called Jomsborg from which they took their name. Even in the tough world of the war-ready Vikings, the warriors of Jomsborg were a formidable force with a strict military code, drawing their strength from adventure-seeking fighters recruited from all over the Viking world. They intervened in several dynastic disputes in Sweden and Norway, as well as having fought with distinction in one of the greatest battles of Viking Scandinavia, the Battle of Svoldr.\\n\\nThe Icelandic Sagas also tell of the Jomsvikings’ favoured method of execution, if and when they were captured and were to be put to the sword. The courageous members of the brotherhood would refuse to be killed from behind, always demanding to face their executors to look them in the eye at the moment of death. A piece of corroborating history lies in the fact that the Jomsvikings were said to have fought both for and against English kings, with certain bits of archaeological proof supporting those claims. In a mass grave uncovered in Dorset, the skeletons of fifty-four decapitated Vikings were found, some with teeth filed down – perceived to a Jomsviking demonstration of bravery – and in the all cases, evidence of decapitation executions rather unusually carried out from the front.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_royal_spears_long	Throughout most of the medieval world, the function of kings and chiefs was, above all, to provide war leadership. Tribal leaders used loyalty systems which granted the best warriors the greatest rewards when in service to their households as companions or bodyguards, which extended onto the battlefield. The systems which existed in Celtic Ireland and Scotland were ones in which martial leaders presided over small and ever-changing kingdoms alongside nobles and royal followers who fought in their direct service. The Welsh, although less influenced by feudalism, also operated under similar systems of the ‘teulu’ – the individual princes’ and chieftains’ personal bodyguards – who typically went to war alongside larger numbers of freemen who made up the bulk of the armies. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_alban_swords_long	The early medieval Highlanders of Alba were a cultural mix of Gaelic, Celtic, and other peoples, who had much in common with similar groups in nearby Ireland and northern Britain. Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women. Their climate made them particularly tough, readily fighting into the depth of winter when required. Even the Vikings were fearful of the Highlanders of northern Britain by their own accounts – the classic Icelandic saga ‘Islendingasagur’ warns other Norsemen to approach parts of the Scottish coast with caution, lest it cost them their lives!\\n\\nThe warriors of Alba were generally made up of territorial units of fighting men.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_kerns_long	The Middle Irish word ‘ceithern’, pronounced ‘kern’, refers to a group of fighters who were one of two essential components of medieval Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, the role of a kern was to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles they filled very much depended on the needs of their clan, which did not exclude them from the cut and thrust of melee warfare. Kerns would frequently be the first or last to launch attacks – their mobility meant that they were well-suited to initiate swift ambushes, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, while later in battles they could also easily run down any fleeing routers.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, kerns wore a light leather coat which ensured unrestricted movement and agility. The throwing spear or javelin was one such genus of weapons they used, with the thrusting variety not always entirely distinct from the thrown variety. The advantage of the javelin thrower was the ability to potentially pierce through shields and armour from distance, but this was offset by the reduced range and limited output compared to standard archers, since there were only so many javelins a thrower could carry at any one time. Javelin throwing was certainly a unique skill, with the most skilful Viking warriors allegedly even able to catch spears in mid-flight to hurl them straight back!	true

Forming the basis of the free populace, they were neither noblemen nor slaves, ranking above the servile classes but below the nobility. A ceorl’s free status was marked by several factors, such as his attendance at local courts, his payment of dues directly to his lord or king, and perhaps most notably for the era, his right to bear arms. In fact, since many ceorls would have been tenants or even landowners, under Anglo-Saxon law they would have been liable for military duty in the fyrd, as was the case in Wessex.\\n\\nBeing freemen, ceorls would have had to provide their own weaponry.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_gallowglasses_long	Gallowglasses were the super-soldiers of the Celtic world, well-trained heavy infantry skilled in the use of all manner of weapons - swords, spears, javelins, bows, darts – as well as the Celtic martial arts. To be a gallowglass one had to be of mixed blood – descended from the union of a settled Nordic raider and a Celtic woman. When Nordic raiders, who harried the coasts of Scotland and Ireland during the Dark Ages, eventually settled and interbred, the offspring of such unions were known as ‘Gael-gall’ – literally 'foreigners who speak Gaelic'. In Ireland the word ‘Galloglaich’ - pronounced ‘Gallowglass’ – was used to explicitly refer to a 'young, foreign warrior'. As has often been the case throughout history, this mixed blood separated gallowglasses from the hierarchy of the Celtic clan system. As such, they had little loyalty to the old order and many became soldiers for hire to the highest bidder. Although technically under the sovereignty of the Norwegian king during this time, many gallowglasses served Scottish rulers or settled in Ireland, where they were more easily accepted, integrating with the native population at all societal levels.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_old_north_horsemen_long	The Old North is the English translation for the name traditionally used to describe the region of the southern Scottish Lowlands and northern Britain in the early Middle Ages. Known in Welsh as 'Yr Henn Ogledd', in early medieval times these areas were mostly inhabited by people of Celtic descent, remaining culturally and linguistically British even after the arrival of foreign groups. The Old North is considered the birthplace of Welsh literature, thought to be the home of the famous early bards Taliesin and Aneirin, as well as many historical characters that were incorporated into Arthurian legend such as Merlin.\\n\\nPictish art also alludes to the Old North as being inhabited by peoples of horse-warrior societies. Their use of spears from horseback had been seen in a similar form around Britain before, with the Roman use of lance-bearing cavalry regiments. Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable. Stirrups ensured stability, so that what had formerly been impossible on horseback in the cut and thrust of battle then became easy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_est_kerns_long	In the centuries following the 8th century appearance of the first recorded Viking raiders in the Irish Sea, those of the Norse who chose to settle in the region came to be known as the ‘Ostmenn’, or more literally, ‘the men of the east’. This was how the settled Norse-Gaels contrasted themselves from the native Gaels, who they referred to as ‘Vestmen’, unsurprisingly, the 'men of the west’. Combining local traditions with their own, the Norse-Gaels were culturally distinct from both the Gaels and their Scandinavian forefathers. Their hybridisation of traditions took place against the setting of their coastal defensive strongholds, many of which were the nuclei of the powerful independent kingdoms of later years. Norse-Gaelic powerbases would eventually be established in places like Dublin, Galloway, and Mann, amongst other places.\\n\\nAs with many facets of their culture, the martial traditions of the Norse-Gaels retained both Viking and Gaelic elements. Those who by some sequence of events ended up landless and not tied to a lord – particularly those with an aptitude for fighting – sometimes ended up living as outlaws in the mountains and woods. Such combatants were known as ‘widcairns’ or wood kerns, and were feared and hated by sedentary peoples in equal measure. Using their terrain and knowledge of swift ambush tactics, they were formidable fighters who took what they needed from those unfortunate enough to venture into their woodland territories. They operated under the leadership of fiery spirits among the youthful gentry and former nobility of Ireland, pushed to the edges of society with resentments and bravado that made them Robin Hood figures to their followers.	true

The prevalence of hunting and the past presence of stationed Roman archers around Britain meant that it was by no means an unknown discipline, with archer regiment tactics varying between the warring groups of the day. Battles often saw periods of missile volley exchanges before the initial melee engagements, so the skill of the bowmen could really turn the tide of battle, as seen with the success of English longbow regiments of later centuries during the Hundred Years War.	true

As a result, most were captured from the coast of Britannia or on the Vikings' forays down the Volga River, where the Norsemen became known as ‘Slavs’. The men who captured the thralls were known to the Mediterranean peoples as the ‘Rus’ – whose land eventually became Russia - or the ‘Varangians’, who of course served as unbiased Imperial bodyguards in the Byzantine Empire that succeeded the Eastern Romans.\\n\\nThe lowest of the low in Nordic society, thralls were pressed into fighting and were often poorly-armed and armoured – the idea behind their use being that they would increase a Nordic army’s size until its opponents were overwhelmed by superior numbers, rather than their skill at arms.

Many Irish records of the early medieval period mention the word ‘aire’ to refer to those in between; a catch-all term describing anyone who held an independent legal status. Written laws dating to later centuries, however, use the word ‘airig’ more specifically in references to nobles or chiefs, distinguishing them from commoners. Indeed, Ireland’s sumptuary laws of the 7th and 8th centuries even refer to the colours that each social class were allowed to wear, including those for the Airig nobility – grey, brown, or red.\\n\\nCommanding a ‘cet’ – a military unit of up to one hundred men – the Airig nobility were high-ranking combatants.
