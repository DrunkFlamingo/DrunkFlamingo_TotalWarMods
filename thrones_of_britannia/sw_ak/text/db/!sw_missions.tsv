missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_hagustaldes	Though Cadwallon of Gwined is still honoured for having defeated King Edwin to take the throne of Jórvík, his rule was short-lived. Oswald, one of the few surviving members of Edwin's family, raised an army. They clashed with Cadwallon's forces at The Battle of the Wall, near Hagustaldes. Here Cadwallon was beaten, pursued from the field, and killed. To take Hagustaldes now would be fitting vengeance for the defeat of one of Wales's greatest heroes.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_9_1	Where an ancient trackway crosses the river Lud, you can find the settlement of Lude. Between fertile low hills and lowland marshes, it is a quiet place of plenty - or was, when Jórvík held sway. It is now part of the Danelaw and the people of Lude have no love for the Vikings, after they attacked their monastery and killed their bishop. They would most likely welcome your rule.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_mission_northymbre_westmoringas	We have heard rumours that the kingdom of Northanhymbra is planning to subjugate their neighbours and then use their armies to invade our lands! We could severely disrupt their plans if we eliminate our rivals before they pull off this plan!	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_rucestr	The day came when Arthur could no longer stand against the Saxon hordes who he had seen off years before at Badon Hill. He fell at Camlann, although scholars still argue about whether Britannia's greatest warlord died on that day, or whether he was mortally wounded then put into a magical sleep from which he may one day awaken. They also disagree about the site of Camlann, although many favour a northern location, most likely Rucestr in the kingdom of Northanhymbra. It pleases you that this place is currently held by the Welsh. An alliance may be wise. 	true
missions_localised_title_vik_fact_east_engle_mission_northymbre_alive	Conquer Jórvík	true
missions_localised_description_vik_fact_east_engle_mission_northymbre_alive	Now that we've established ourselves as a powerful kingdom, we should eliminate our biggest rivals. Remove Jórvík from the map!	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_loidis	The riverside settlement of Loidis was one of the most important towns in the kingdom of Elmet. Though Arthur probably never ruled here, his example inspired the Britons of Elmet, allowing them to hold out against invasion for many years before finally being attacked, and overcome, by the English kingdom of Eoforwic. Later, the Vikings came and took Loidis for themselves, making it part of the Danelaw. Now it is ruled by true Britons again, and they might make useful allies.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_doneceaster	Cadwallon was Gwined's greatest warlord. On marshland near Doneceaster, Cadwallon defeated and killed King Edwin of Northanhymbra. Edwin, a long-time rival, had encroached deep into Cadwallon's territory but Cadwallon fought back, entering into an alliance with Penda of Mierce and marching on Northanhymbra. After defeating Edwin Cadwallon went on to rule Northanhymbra for a year, a reign which later English writers viewed as tyrannical but which all true Britons see as an inspiration. What better way to remember this great victory than to take Doneceaster for yourself.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_fact_east_engle_mission_northymbre_dead	Our brethren in the Kingdom of Jórvík have fallen to enemy incursions. We cannot stand for this - let us conquer this land for ourselves.	true
missions_localised_title_vik_fact_east_engle_mission_northymbre_dead	Reclaim Jórvík	true
missions_localised_description_vik_mission_northymbre_northleode_b	Our rapid subjugation of Westmoringas has not deterred Northanhymbra from attacking, but it has at least secured the western border. Now we just have to destroy Northanhymbra!	true
missions_localised_description_vik_mission_northymbre_northleode_a	Our worst fears have been realised: Northanhymbra has vassalised Westmoringas and then declared war on us! We will have to fight off both of them now.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_mission_strat_clut_northleode	The lands held by Northanhymbra should rightfully belong to us, but they have repeatedly refused our demands to turn them over to our control. The only solution at this stage is war! Eliminate Northanhymbra!	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_loidis	The riverside settlement of Loidis was one of the most important towns in the kingdom of Elmet, which was at its height in the days of Arthur, warlord of the Britons. Elmet held out against the Saxon invaders for many years before finally being attacked, and overcome, by the English kingdom of Northanhymbra. But all things pass, and so the Vikings came and took it for themselves, making it part of the Danelaw. Perhaps it could be yours now.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_hagustaldes	Cadwallon of Gwined was a great hero, fighting back against English oppression to defeat King Edwin of Northanhymbra and take his throne. Oswald, one of the few surviving members of Edwin's family, raised an army to take back his kinsman's lands. Cadwallon met Oswald's army at the Battle of the Wall, near Hagustaldes, and lost. Oswald hunted down and killed Cadwallon, ending an all-too-brief period of resurgence for the true Britons. But as Hagustaldes is currently ruled by the Welsh, perhaps you should seek an alliance, to remind the English whose land this truly is.  	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_rucestr	Camlann is held to be Arthur's final battle when the Saxons, having regrouped and returned in greater numbers after being defeated at Badon Hill, finally overwhelmed the Britons. Scholars still argue about whether Britannia's greatest warlord died on that day, or whether he was mortally wounded then put into a magical sleep from which he may one day awaken. Scholars also disagree about the site of Camlann, although many favour a northern location, most likely Rucestr in the kingdom of Northanhymbra. To take this site back would be fitting vengeance on the English.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_doneceaster	Cadwallon is remembered as Gwined's strongest warlord, and he fought his greatest battle near Doneceaster. King Edwin of Northanhymbra had overshadowed Cadwallon for much of his life, more recently claiming parts of Gwined for his own. In response, Cadwallon formed an alliance with Penda of Mierce, and together they defeated and killed Edwin and his heir. Cadwallon went on to rule Northanhymbra for a year, a reign which later English writers viewed as tyrannical but which is an inspiration to all true Britons. This territory is back in the hands of the Welsh, and you may wish to ally yourself with them.	true
