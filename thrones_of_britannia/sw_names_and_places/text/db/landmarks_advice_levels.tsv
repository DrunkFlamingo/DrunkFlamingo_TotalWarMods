advice_levels_onscreen_text_40000	Aberffro was the capital of the Kingdom of Gwined from 860 AD until 1170 AD. Under the eponymous dynasty under Rhodri Mawr, it came to be the most important political centre in medieval Wales. The Royal estates of the Princes of Aberffro were governed from the Llys, or the Royal court, and as Aberffro was the central one, thus the palace grew. It was from here that the officials of the prince's court sallied forth to gather taxes and rent from the surrounding commotes. In the 9th century, Rhodri the Great had inherited Gwined from his father and Powys from his mother, and he added Seisilwig by a dynastic marriage to Angharad of Seisyllwg. Rhodri's influence in the rest of Wales was significant, and he left a lasting legacy.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40001	Aberteifi was selected at a very early period as an eligible site for commerce given its naval accessibility with distant parts of the kingdom. The Welsh name Aberteifi (later known as "Ceredig's land") refers to its position by the mouth (aber) of the River Teifi. Ceredig was supposedly one of the sons of Cunedda Wledig, who Welsh legend records invaded from the north to recover lands in Roman Britain from invading Irishmen around early 400 AD.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40002	Achadh Bo contains a large number of Early Christian farmsteads, known as ringforts. Achadh Bo Abbey was founded in the sixth century by St. Canice. The abbey grew into a major centre of learning, commerce and agriculture. It was plundered by the Vikings in 913 AD and rebuilt in 1052 with relics of St Canice enshrined. It was again burned in 1116 AD and rebuilt in 1189.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40003	This area is known as the Isle of Aethelingaeg because it was once a very low isolated island in the very great swampy and impassable marshes of the Somersaete Levels. It was here that Alfred came in 877AD to escape from the Danes who threatened to overrun his kingdom. Alfred stayed at Aethelingaeg from the autumn of 877 until the spring of 878 when he had a fortress built. Here Alfred reorganized his forces and prepared to launch an offensive that culminated in his pivotal victory at the Battle of Edington. About a decade later, Alfred founded a monastery which was dedicated to St Athelwine and was meant to commemorate his victory and give thanks to God.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40004	Inber Nise was one of the chief strongholds of the Picts, and in 565 AD was visited by St Columba with the intention of converting the Pictish king Brude, who is supposed to have resided in the vitrified fort on Craig Phadrig, on the western edge of the city. The strategic location of Inber Nise has led to many conflicts in the area. Reputedly there was a battle in the early 11th century between King Malcolm and Thorfinn of Norway at Blar Nam Feinne, to the southwest of the city.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40005	Ard Macha means "Macha's height" and began as a Ulaid pagan ritual site to the goddess Macha. Macha is associated with the land, fertility, kingship, war and horses. After Christianity spread to Ériu, the pagan sanctuary was converted into a Christian one, and Ard Macha became the site of an important church and monastery. According to tradition, Saint Patrick founded his main church there in the year 457 AD, and it eventually became the "ecclesiastical capital" of Ériu. In 839 and 869, the monastery in Ard Macha was raided by Vikings who were seeking silver, as such could often be found in churches and monasteries.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40006	The village of Bebbanburg was the seat of the Northanhymbra Kingdom for several hundred years. It is dominated by its great sandstone castle which stands on a massive outcrop overlooking a beautiful beach and the Farne Islands out at sea. One of the most powerful Northybmren kings associated with Bebbanburg was King Oswald (634-642 AD), who converted to Christianity and appointed St Aidan as the first bishop of nearby Lindisfarne, making this north eastern corner of Northanhymbra an important focal point for early Christian cultural developments. Dominance of Anglo-Saxon power in the area came to an end when the Vikings conquered Jórvík in 866. The castle atop the hill was completely destroyed by the Vikings in 993 AD.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40007	It is believed that Vikings came to Blascona late in the 8th century. It is not known whether Vikings came as landtakers, dispossessing indigenous Pict peoples, or whether Viking farmers settled peacefully among the natives of Blascona or some of both. In any case, it appears that the Norse immigrants soon assumed dominance over any communities there. In time, Blascona came to be ruled by jarls established by royal authority from Norway. The raiders used Blascona as a base of operations from which to carry out aggressive raids against the coasts of Scotland as well as their own Norwegian kin.  Harold Hårfagre ("Fair Hair") subdued the rovers in 875 and annexed both Blascona to Norway.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40008	In the 9th century, Vikings invaded Bòrnais and the gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata to the south, and established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout these lands. Following Norwegian unification, the Kingdom of the Isles became a crown dependency of the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians it was Suðreyjar (meaning southern isles). At Kilpheder, the roundhouses were abandoned in favour of Norse longhouses; at Bornish, a few miles to the north, a more substantial Norse settlement was built. The strategic position gave the local residents access to a wide trading network, stretching throughout the Norwegian empire, as well as adjacent lands like Ériu.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40009	Cair Gwent was at the center of the Gwent Welsh kingdom between the Rivers Wye and Usk. It was founded by the Romans in 75 AD as Venta Silurum, a market town for the defeated Silures tribe. Some historians hypothesize that Cair Gwent is the Welsh name for Camelot. Thomas Malory wrote that twelve of Arthur's defeated enemies were buried in St. Stephen's church in Camelot, also recording that Arthur and Guinevere were married in this same church. While other historians argue Malory could have confused Caerwent with Caerwynt (the Welsh name for Winchester), it's notable that there exists a known St. Stephen's church in Cair Gwent but not in Winchester.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40010	The Rock of Caisil is one of the most breathtaking castles in all of Ériu. It sits upon an isolated elevation of stratified limestone that rises abruptly from a broad and fertile plain called the Golden Vale. Originally known as Fairy Hill, the Rock was the dun, or fort, of the ancient Chiefs of Munster. In the 5th century, the Eóganachta dynasty founded their capital on and around the rock. Many kings of Munster have reigned here since. Saint Patrick is believed to have baptised Cashel's third king, Aengus. In 977 AD the Dál gCais usurper, Brian Boru, was crowned here as the first non-Eóghanacht king of Cashel and Munster in over five hundred years.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40011	Cantwaraburg decayed after the Romans left Britain in 410 and was  abandoned until later when an Anglo-Saxon community formed within the city walls. Pope Gregory sent Augustine in 597 to convert its King Æthelberht, thereafter selecting the town as the center for his Episcopal See. The town's new importance led to its revival -- a mint was established, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. In the 9th century, the town suffered great loss of life during Danish raids. In 978, Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it St Augustine's Abbey. A second wave of Danish attacks began in 991, and in 1011 the cathedral was burnt and the bishop was killed.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40012	Carleol began as a Roman town called Luguvalium but fell  into decay in 407 AD when the Roman rule ended. St Cuthbert founded a monastery in the ruins of Carleol in 685. From that time on, Carleol was an important stronghold contested by several entities who warred over the area, including Strat Clut and Northymbre. In 876 the Vikings captured Carleol and sacked it. The monks moved away but some people probably continued to live within the walls of the old Roman town. By the time of the Norman conquest in 1066, Carleol was part of Scotland. Carleol was rebuilt and revived by the Norman King William Rufus in 1092. He built a wooden castle there and encouraged people to come and settle.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40013	Cathair Commain is a triple stone ringfort that served an important role in the collecting of tribute and patronage that was crucial to the working of the small kingdoms. Cathair Commain was also strategically important to the local economy for its ability to process wool and produce many fine clothes as well as metalworking. A once dominant and coopted clan like the Ui Chormaic may have used the structure as a location for collecting cattle tribute prior to their delivery to the ultimate recipient, such as the Corcu Modruadh. The abandonment in the 10th century may tie in with the rise of the Dál gCais, who rose to dominance in the Burren around that time.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40014	The city of Ceaster was founded as a fort by the Romans in 79 AD. In Welsh legend, King Arthur is said to have fought his ninth battle against the Saxon invasion at the "city of the legions". In 616, Æthelfrith of Northybmre defeated a Welsh army and established Saxon rule in the area from then on. The Saxons adopted the native name as the calque Legeceaster, which eventually became Ceaster. A civilian settlement grew around the settlement over time, probably starting as a group of traders and their families. The fortress was 20% larger than other fortresses in that time which has led to the suggestion that the fortress may have been intended to become the capital of the province rather than Lunden.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40015	Cetretha was originally the center of an ancient British kingdom called Catraeth. In 598 AD King Aethelfrith's men heavily defeated the native Britons in a great battle at this location. Presumably the last stand of the Northern Welsh, the battle of Cetretha was a disaster for the Britons. They were slain almost to a man, and the kingdoms of Gododdin and Rheged melted away into the shrouds of history. Aethelfrith's power was now beyond dispute and the Celts were forced to accept his rule. Cetretha would always remain an important economic and military centre regardless of who controlled it.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40016	This large market town was established in 600 AD on a crossing of the River Avon. In 877 King Alfred formed a supposedly ‘firm peace’ with the Viking leader Guthrum at Exanceaster, but it was clear that they were intent on permanent conquest thus their withdrawal took them no further than Mercia. Alfred was at Cippanhamm by Christmas, but it was a disastrous mistake and Guthrum’s forces attacked on Twelfth Night, inflicting such a major defeat that Alfred was forced to undertake a guerrilla campaign from the Somerset marshes. Within a year, Alfred had restored his position sufficiently to win a substantial victory at the Battle of Edington, forcing Guthrum to sign a permanent peace treaty.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40017	Cluain Mac Nois was founded in 550 AD by Saint Ciaran and it was because of its location that it became bigger and more important than any other monastery at the time. There was a huge farm, traders, crafts, and people such as metal workers and stone carving workshops that produced High Crosses as well as grave slabs. The site boasted a huge population and became a centre for producing manuscripts and education that drew scholars from as far afield as continental Europe. But like nearly all monastic settlements in Ériu, Cluain Mac Nois was plundered on several occasions by invaders, including the Vikings and Anglo-Normans.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40018	Colneceaster began as a center of the local Celtic tribe, the Trinovantes, until the Romans invaded Britain and built a fort in this center around 44 AD. Town life declined after the Romans left. The isolated raids by Vikings took a far more serious turn in 865 when a great army of Danes under the command of Ivar the Boneless invaded the Kingdom of East Anglia. In 869 King Edmund of East Anglia was defeated and killed by the Danes and the East fell under Danish control. Under a peace treaty between Wessex and the Danes in 879, Colneceaster was incorporated into Danelaw. The Kings of Wessex waged continual war on the Danes and finally Colneceaster was recaptured by English armies under Edward the Elder in 917.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40019	Corcach was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century. Corcach achieved an urban character at some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman settlers founded a trading port. Much like Dyflin, Corcach was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40020	The area of Din Prys was first inhabited by the Selgovae tribe, then the Romans, and then the Britons. Twelve of King Arthur's battles were recorded by Nennius in Historia Brittonum. The Battle of Tribruit (the 10th battle), has been suggested as having possibly been near Din Prys or near the mouth of the river Avon near Bo'ness. After the Roman departure the area around Din Prys has changed hands many times between the Picts, Anglo-Saxons, Scots and Norse culminating in a decisive victory for Gregory, King of Scots at what is now Lochmaben over the native Britons in 890. Its strategic importance at the mouth of the river would constantly highlight its importance as a military conquest.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40021	Dinefwr is one of several Welsh petty kingdoms that emerged in 5th-century based on the former territory of the Demetae. Tradition relates that a castle was first constructed on this site by Rhodri the Great. Dinefwr was subject to extensive raids during the Viking Age between the 8th and 11th centuries, causing social and political instability, and with the Vikings establishing settlements in southern Dinefwr. By the latter part of the 9th century, the rulers of Dinefwr had grown cautious of the influence of the sons of Rhodri the Great, and sought out an alliance with Alfred the Great, integrating their powers with the English.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40022	Because of its position, Dofere controls the English Channel and is known as the 'Lock and Key of England'. Julius Caesar tried to land at Dofere during the Roman Invasion of 55 BC and turned it into an important harbor. Later in the 5th century the Saxons founded another settlement at Dofere. In the 9th century Alfred the Great created a network of fortified settlements across his kingdom called burhs. In the event of a Danish attack all the men in the area could gather in the local burh to fight them. In the 10th century Dofere was made a burh. An earth rampart probably protected it with a wooden palisade on top. But Dofere was more than a fortress. It was also a busy little town with weekly markets and a mint.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40023	Doreceaster was founded by the Romans and in the 4th century the settlement was given stone walls. The town was mostly abandoned after the Romans left, but people gradually seem to have trickled back into it over the next century. At some point a market began and slowly Doreceaster grew into a town again. One of the first raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Doreceaster around 790. According to a chronicler, the King's reeve assembled a few men and sped to meet them thinking that they were merchants from another country. When he arrived at their location, he admonished them and instructed that they should be brought to the royal town. The Vikings then slaughtered him and his men.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40024	Drayton  was not mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086. However it probably grew into a little town in the late 11th century or early 12th century. At that time international trade was booming. Drayton was well situated to trade with Europe and it soon became a busy little port. Drayton also became a focal point for the surrounding villages. It grew into a market town.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40025	Druim dá Ethiar takes its name from the ridge of high ground on which it is located above the Bonnet river ("Ridge of Two Demons"). Druim dá Ethiar was the capital of Breifne and the seat of the O'Rourkes - the ancient Kings of Brieifne. It was in 'The Song of O'Ruark' by Thomas Moore that this area became immortalised in song:\\n\\n"The valley lay smiling before me,\\nWhere lately I left her behind;\\nYet I trembled, and something hung o'er me,\\nThat sadden'd the joy of my mind"	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40026	Dún Att rises proudly from an expanse of bog that carpets the southern end of Kilmartin Glen. It served as a capital stronghold and as an administrative and cultural centre for the Dal Riata and other Gaelic kings in the 500s to 800s AD. Dún Att is mentioned twice in early sources. In 683 the Annals of Ulster record: "The siege of Dún At and the siege of Dún Duirn" without further comment on the outcome or participants. In the same chronicle the entry for 736 states: "Aengus son of Fergus, king of the Picts, laid waste the territory of Dál Riata and seized Dún Att and burned Creic and bound in chains two sons of Selbach"	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40027	Dún Beccán derives its name from Old Gaelic Dùn Bheccáin ("fort of Beccán"), Beccán being the name of a Norse chieftan. The village of Dún Beccán lies on the east side of the head of Loch Dún Beccán, which bites deeply into the Isle of Skye from the north west, turning the area known as Duirinish into a peninsula. It likely served as an important trading checkpoint and a staging ground for raiders who wanted to penetrate more South from Northern shores. In the 13th century the smaller fort was left to ruin by Clan MacLeod and Dunvegan Castle was erected instead and continued to be an important trading port for the North. 	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40028	Dùn Cailden ("Fort of the Caledonii") dates back to the sixth century when a monastery was founded beside the River Tay. It emerged as a centre of Christianity during the 7th Century, when Columba came over from Iona, and much work was carried out by his successors. In the 9th Century, Kenneth MacAlpin, the first King of Scots, made Dùn Cailden head of the Celtic Church and capital of the newly-formed nation created by the union of the Scots and the Picts. Kenneth I of Scotland is reputed to have brought relics of St Columba from Iona in 849, in order to preserve them from Viking raids, building a new church to replace the existing structures that had been damaged from the raiding parties.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40029	Dún Foither was originally a Pictish fortress of strategic importance. A siege in 681 AD happened in the reign of King Bridei, who was attempting to unite the Picts by force against the overlordship of the Angles. After Bridei’s death in 693 AD a power struggle ensued in Pictland, thus the second siege of Dún Foither, may have been part of a bitter Pictish civil war. Over thirty years later Dún Foither was the scene of one of the most important battles of the Dark Ages - one which could be looked upon as the first ever big battle between the Scots and the English. In this episode Constantine II defied the conquest of Æthelstan, King of Wessex, by surviving a month-long siege at Dún Foither.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40030	Dún Pátraic takes its name from a dún(fort), which once stood on the hill that dominates the town, Rath Celtair, named after the mythological warrior of Ulster called Celtchar. Saint Patrick was reputedly buried here in 461 together with Saint Brigit and Saint Columba. From the seventh century the dominant power in Ulster was the Dál Fiatach so much so that the title "Rí Uladh" could simultaneously mean "King of Ulster" and "King of the Dál Fiatach". County Down was the ancient centre of the Dál Fiatach lands, and the chief royal site of the Dál Fiatach was at Dún Pátraic from where they ruled Ulster for centuries. Dún Pátraic was an administrative seat that was also well known for its textile industry.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40031	Dún Sebuirgi was part of a Gaelic overkingdom, Dál Riata, that included parts of western Scotland and northeastern Ériu, on each side of the North Channel. At its height in the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the Dál Riata encompassed roughly what is now Argyll in Scotland and part of County Antrim in the Irish province of Ulster. In the Book of Armagh, published by Sir William Betham, Ulster King at Arms, we are informed that St. Patrick "At Dún Sebuirgi sat upon a rock, which is called St. Patrick's rock to this day, and there he consecrated holy Olcan bishop, whom he himself had educated, and he returned into the plain of Eilne, and erected many other church, which the Coindiri possess."	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40032	In the 9th century, Vikings invaded this territory and established the earliest and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ériu. The settlement was on the River Poddle in the area known as Wood Quay. The Dubh Linn was a lake used by the Vikings to moor their ships. They ruled Dyflin for almost three centuries, during which time they were expelled in 902 only to return in 917 and famously defeated by the Irish High King Brian Boru at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.  From that date, the Danes firmly opted for a commercial life. Viking rule of Dyflin lasted until 1171 when the city was captured by King Dermot MacMurrough of Leinster, with the aid of Anglo-Norman mercenaries lead by Strongbow.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40033	Earmutha was founded in the 5th century by the Angles. In 870 AD, Lodbrog the Dane, driven by a sudden tempest from Denmark across the sea, landed at Reedham where the Court of Edmund, King of East Anglia, was then kept. Lodbrog is said to have been received into Court favour but was soon afterwards murdered in a wood by the King's huntsman from jealousy. This later led to the imprisonment and execution of Edmund and put an end to the Saxon dynasty in East Anglia, after Hinguar and Hubba, two Danish chieftains, at the head of 20,000 men, had ravished all East Anglia. By the time of the Domesday Book, in 1086, Earmutha had grown into a little town with a population of a few hundred.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40034	At some point before the 7th century, the Gododdin people built a hillfort somewhere within the bounds of modern Eidenburg. In 638 AD the stronghold was besieged and came under Northanhymbran rule, but marked the north west extremity of the Angles' kingdom. In the late ninth century the Danelaw, centred on Jórvík, was established in the wake of Viking raids on Britain. The northern part was cut off from the rest of England by the Old Norse-speaking Danes, significantly weakening what remained of the kingdom. During the tenth century its northernmost part came under the sway of the Kingdom of Scotland. In 973 AD the English king, Edgar the Peaceful, formally granted Eidenburg to Kenneth II, King of Scots.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40035	Jórvík has swapped hands several times during the course of history, eventually becoming an economic centre under the Saxons. The prosperity of the city made it an obvious target for Ivar the Boneless who captured the city and made it the capitol of their new territory in northern England. The Vikings established a peaceable community based on agriculture and trade, but the Viking influence lasted less than a century. In 954 Eric Bloodaxe was defeated by Eadred, King of Wessex. Eadred forged an alliance between the northern Kingdom of Northanhymbra and his own domains in the south. Viking power ended in 1066, when an invasion led by Harald Hardrada was defeated at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, just 8 miles from Jórvík.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40036	This town began around 55 AD when Roman occupiers established a fort named Isca on a dry ridge overlooking a navigable river teeming with fish. With fertile land nearby, the presence of the fort built up an unplanned civilian community of natives and the soldiers' families; it served as the tribal capital of the Dumnonii until sometime in the 7th century when ownership of the land transferred to the Saxons around the time that they defeated the Dumnonians at in 658. In 876, it was attacked and briefly captured by Danes until Alfred drove them out the next summer. Over the next few years, he elevated Exanceaster to one of the four burhs in Devon, rebuilding its walls on the Roman lines.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40037	Gipeswic is one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon towns in England. Gipeswic started in as a small trading settlement in the early 7th century. It was ideally situated to trade with Frankia. Whetstones and millstones were imported from Frankia into Gipeswic. Wool was exported. In Anglo-Saxon Gipeswic there were many weavers of wool. There were also potters and many other craftsmen. Gipeswic also had a mint. However because of its position in the East of England Gipeswic was vulnerable to attack by the Danes. The Danes occupied Gipeswic from 869 until 917 when it was recaptured by the English.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40038	Gleawceaster owes its name, strategic location and much of its layout to many centuries of Roman occupation. The first settlement was a military fortress at Kingsholm, established in the late 40s, and it eventually developed into one of the chief settlements in Roman Britain. The settlement was captured by the Saxons following the decisive battle Dyrham in 577. By the tenth century, Gloucester continued to be an important centre for Mercia, and was famously re-planned and re-fortified by Queen Aethelflaed as a defense against the marauding Danes. Aethelflaed also founded the New Minster Church of St Oswald which became a shrine of great importance following the recovery and internment of St Oswald's bones.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40039	In the 1st century AD the Romans built a fort on Castle Hill but it was abandoned at the beginning of the 5th century AD as the Roman Empire declined. Grantabrycg was founded in 875 when the Danes conquered Eastern England. They created a fortified town on the site which would have been surrounded by a ditch and an earth rampart probably with a wooden palisade on top. In the 10th century Grantabrycg was captured by the Saxons. However in 1010 Grantabrycg was burned by the Danes. That was an easy task when all the buildings were of wood with thatched roofs.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40040	The origins of the stone fort of Grianán of Aileach date back to 1700 BC. The Tuatha de Danann invaded Ériu before the Celts and built stone forts on top of strategic hills. They worshiped Dagda (the Good God) and he too is associated with the origins of Aileach. It was he who ordered the building of a stone fort to act as a burial monument to his dead son. A well just beyond the fortress walls supplied water to the nearby villagers and was believed to have magical properties, a reputation which may have developed from its history with St. Patrick, who is said to have baptized the local chieftain here in 450. It later served as the seat of the Kingdom of Ailech and one of the royal sites of Gaelic Ériu.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40041	Guvan originated as part of the ancient Kingdom of Strat Clut where the local language was a form of Cymro-Celtic, related to Welsh. The term "Guv" designated an artistan who prepared metal from raw ore. It has been suggested that the workshops of the early Christian artisans may have given its name to both the village and the parish. According to legend, the site was founded by St. Constantine who brought Christianity to the area when he founded a monastic settlement around the year 565 AD -- he was later buried in front of the High Altar of the Church. During the Viking Age, Guvan served as the seat of the King of Strat Clut until it became part of Scotland.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40042	Sometimes in the 7th century after Angle occupation, Gyruum became a center of learning and had the largest library north of the Alps, primarily due to the widespread travels of Benedict Biscop, its founder. In 794 Jarrow became the second target in England of the Vikings, who had plundered Lindisfarne in 793. In the 8th century, the monastery of Saint Paul in Gyruum was the home of Bede, who is regarded as the greatest Anglo-Saxon scholar and the father of English history. A much under-publicised fact is that the world's oldest complete Bible, written in Latin and to be presented to the then Pope (Gregory II) was produced at this monastery.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40043	The name "Haestingas" derives from its tribal name, "the people of the Hastings tribe." In 771 AD King Offa of Mercia invaded Southern England, and over the next decade  seized control of Sussex and Kent. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that Vikings overran "all Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hastings", indicating the town was still considered a separate 'county' or province to its neighbours 240 years after Offa's conquest. The start of the Norman Conquest was the Battle of Hastings in which William the Conqueror defeated and killed Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon King of England. With the Saxon Army destroyed, William was free to march on Lunden, thus opening the rest of England to Norman conquest.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40044	Hylmrekr was established by the Vikings on an island on the River Shannon in 922 AD. In that year a Viking jarl called Tomrair mac Ailchi led the Hylmrekr fleet on raids along the River Shannon pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. Two years later, the Dyflin vikings led by Gofraid ua Ímair attacked Hylmrekr, but were driven off. The war between Dyflin and Hylmrekr continued until 937 when the Dyfliners captured Hylmrekr's king and destroyed his fleet. The 920s and 930s are regarded as the height of Norse power in Ériu and only Hylmrekr rivalled Dyflin during this time. The last Norse king of the city was Ivar of Hylmrekr, who is suspected to be the same Ivar who invaded England some years prior.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40046	The island of Ioua is the symbolic centre of Scottish Christianity. Thanks to its founder, St Columba, the island has always been revered as a holy place, and has continually been re-invented and reconstructed as a centre for pilgrimage. Ioua's fame began in 563 AD when Columba, with thirteen followers, landed at the south end of the island to establish the first monastery which would become a centre of pilgrimage. Some of the most famous Kings of Alba, from Kenneth MacAlpin to MacBeth, made their final journey there to the burial ground, the Relig Oran.  Wealthy pilgrims brought money to the monastery, and in the 8th century some of the finest medieval works of art were created to glorify Columba.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40047	Lindcylne was first built up by the Celts in 500 BC but later became an important industrial centre to the Romans in 70 AD. Invading Angles settled in the Midland areas of what eventually became the Kingdom of Lindsey during the 6th century. It maintained its independence until it was absorbed by Mercia in the 8th century. In 865 a formidable Danish raiding army, led by Ivar the Bonless, landed in East Anglia and established winter quarters there. Within a few years, this force succeeded in conquering Mercia and all the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except Wessex. Scandinavian settlers followed the raiders into the swathe of England under Danish control, which became known as the Danelaw.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40048	Loidis was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet and it was on the River Aire that the first village was established. It gradually absorbed all nearby townships and became a major European city. The coming of the Vikings saw Yorkshire divided into thirdings or 'ridings.' These were subdivided into wapentakes where the local assembly met. The villages south of the Aire; Armley, Beeston, Farnley, Hunslet and the rest were part of the Morley wapentake. Those to the north, like Loidis and Cookridge, were in the Skyrack wapentake which met at the old oak tree in Headingley.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40049	At its height, Roman Lunden had a population of around 60,000 until Roman rule ended in the 5th century, at which point Lunden ceased to be a capital and the walled city was effectively abandoned. From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city. By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port but declined from Viking assaults. Lunden was granted to Danelaw as part of a treaty in 878, but Alfred reconquered Lunden in 886 from an independent Viking force. Lunden then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically. By the 11th century, Lunden was beyond all comparison the largest town in England.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40050	Maeldune is a maritime and market town in the County of Essex situated on the Blackwater estuary. "Maeldune" is the Saxon spelling of the Roman Maldon and means "a cross on the hill". There was a late Roman port here, on low ground on the south bank of the River Blackwater, but the main settlement grew further up the hill, where around 914 AD King Edward the Elder built a fortified town.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40051	Mameceaster began when a wooden fort was built by the Roman army on a plateau about 80 AD. The Romans called it Mamucium (breast shaped hill). However in 407 the Roman army left Britain and the civilian settlement disappeared and the stone fort fell into ruin. Christianity came to Mameceaster at the beginning of the seventh century after Edwin, King of Northymbre was baptised in Jórvík in 627. The first Danish ships arrived on the East Coast of Northern England in 787 AD and Mameceaster may well have been a place of refuge for people fleeing South.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40052	Mathrafal has been the traditional capital of the Kingdom of Powys since the 9th century. The rugged terrain of Wales is broken up by mountains and river valleys and does not make for a unified control. The boundaries were not marked by natural defenses, and productive pastures were open to frequent attacks. Not until Offa of Mercia built his dyke in the 8th century was there a definable frontier, designed mainly to deter Welsh attacks and control trade across the new border. In the ninth century the political order which had emerged among the peoples west of Offa's Dyke broke down and into the vacuum stepped a new breed, the High Kings of all Wales.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40053	Nás has had a long and colourful history. In annals and records the name appears in three forms, namely, An Nás meaning “the Place of Assembly” Nás Laighean meaning “Place of assembly of the Leinster Men”, and Nás na Ríogh meaning “Place of Assembly of the Kings”. Nás was founded, according to Bardic tradition, by Lewy of the Long Hand, and from the earliest times was an important centre. It was for almost seven centuries the seat of the Kings of Leinster. The last King to reside here was Cearbhall who died in 904 AD, St Patrick visited Nás in 448 AD and baptised King Dunling’s children at the well at Oldtown, near the town.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40054	Northhamtun began as a Saxon village. It was called Hamm tun, which means the village by the well-watered meadow. When they occupied Eastern England in the late 9th century the Danes turned Northhamtun into a stronghold, but it was also a place of trade where craftsmen worked and where goods were bought and sold at a market. Despite the fact that it was a fortified settlement the town was captured by the English under the Wessex king Edward the Elder in 917. It was conquered again in 940 by the Vikings of Jórvík, who devastated the area, only for the county to be retaken by the English in 942. Consequently, it is one of the few counties in England to have both Saxon and Danish town-names and settlements.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40055	Northwic (wic is an old word for port and Norwich was an inland port) started as a small Anglo-Saxon settlement north of the river Wensum in Norfolk. In time it grew into a town, perhaps because of its situation on a river as it was much cheaper and easier to transport goods for sale by water than by land. The name Northwic first appears on a coin minted in the early 10th century. By then Northwic was a large and important town. It had a mint and would have had a weekly market. Northwic was probably also a burgh or fortified settlement. The town would have been surrounded by a ditch and earth embankment with a wooden palisade on top.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40056	Otergimele derives from Oddrgrimir meaning the son of Grimm and inked with the Old Norse word Melr meaning Sandbank. The population of some 200 was scattered thinly across the region. It was at the North-East end of Otergimele where blown sand gave way to new fish supplies from the River Ribble Estury that a small concentration of people had gathered. The alluvium provided fertile agricultural land. It was here that a primitive church was built, which gave the emerging village its name of Churchtown, the parish being North Meols (pronounced "meals", not "mells"). A church called St Cuthbert's is still at the centre of Churchtown.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40057	Ráth Cruachan is mentioned as one of the four major Royal Sites of Ériu and is known as a place of the royal seat of Queen Medb in the 1st century. Most notably Queen Medb was the warrior queen of Connacht, the western province of Ériu.  It is said that her father was king of Connacht before becoming High King of Ériu and she became ruler of Connacht after him.  She had five recognised husbands, and ruled for over 60 years.  She was also said to be the reason her husbands became kings, that to be the ruler of Connacht they had to be 'married to Medb' as in married to the land.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40058	Rendlaesham was once the capital of the Kings of East Anglia, and the history of St Gregory's goes back to at least the 7th century. Indeed, the very name of the village hints at its Anglo-Saxon heritage, for the word Rendlaesham is thought to come from a combination of words meaning 'place of the shield'. Raedwald, a descendant of the first King of the East Angles, reigned from roughly 599–624 AD. He was a Christian, but his wife was a pagan, so he came up with an ingenious solution. Raedwald established his royal church at Rendlaesham, and in the church were two altars, one pagan and one Christian.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40059	Rofesceaster comes from the British word ‘duro’ meaning a ‘gate, town with gateways, walled town’ with and Old English word ‘ceaster’ as a ‘city, an old fortification, roman site’ combined with an unknown place-name. Aethelberht walled it in 600 AD, and founded a missionary church, which became the nucleus of the cathedral. From its situation as the most accustomed passage over the river Medway, the town has been subject to more misfortunes than most other places. In 676, Ethelred, king of Mercia, having invaded Cent, destroyed this city, and returned with great plunder to his own kingdom. It also suffered from the inhumanity of the Danes in the 9th century, being often besieged and plundered by them.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40060	Scoan was traditionally the capital of a Pictish kingdom and played a crucial role in the formation and governance of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland from the 9th century and on. It was in these years that Kenneth MacAlpin came east to Scoan bringing with him a holy relic and coronation stone which being housed at Scoan acquired the name, the Stone of Scoan over time. The Stone of Scoan is a powerful symbol of Scottish sovereignty. According to legend, the sandstone slab was used by the biblical figure Jacob as a pillow when he dreamed of a ladder reaching to heaven and was then brought to Scotland by way of Egypt, Spain and Ériu. The rock has been used for centuries in the coronation ceremonies of Scottish monarchs.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40061	Seolesigge ("seal's island") was founded in the 6th century by Saxons led by Aella who landed near Pevensey. It was from here that they carved out a kingdom in southern England called Sussex ("South Saxons"). At first the Saxons were pagans but converted to Christianity in the 7th century. St Wilfrid (634-709) was a leading light in converting Sussex. In 681 he built a monastery and a cathedral at Seolesigge and he lived there till 686. Through the centuries the town has maintained its status as a quiet village. Some of the villagers made their living from farming, some from fishing (Seolesigge was especially known for cockles). It has always thrived despite being subject subject to frequent floods.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40062	Almost in the heart of the Midlands, on a commanding site stands the town of Snotingaham. The first mentions of it pop up in the time of the Danish invasion. In 869, the hardy Danes occupied the town, and were besieged by Alfred and Aethelred. A treaty of peace was temporarily concluded, but in the spring of 874 they returned in ever-increasing numbers, conquered Mercia, and occupied the five boroughs of Snotingaham, Lindcylne, Steanford, Deoraby, and Leicester. Here they remained until Edward the Elder, assisted by his sister, Aethelflaed, drove them away. Edward’s capture of Snotingaham in 919 proved to be the crown of his conquests in Central England.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40063	When the Roman Legions withdrew  in 410 AD, local leaders invited groups of Saxons to settle in Steanford as a counter against invaders. However, these supposed protectors rebelled and instead undertook a period of invasion and settlement. From the 5th to the 6th century A.D., these invaders soon became settlers and developed a farming system based on a manor of  two or three open fields. The Anglo-Saxons were good water engineers, and knew how to grind corn with water mills; it was around the nucleus of the manor, mills, and, later, the church, that Steanford grew. By the 8th-9th centuries, the Vale was being run systematically by large estates granted by the Crown to nobles and the Church.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40064	The Romans built a town on a bend in the River Itchen in 70AD; the Saxon king, Ine, built Suthhamtun on the other side of the Itchen about 690-700 AD. It was a large and important port with an estimated population of four thousand, which was very large for the time. Craftsmen made things like needles and combs from animal bone, but the main export was wool. There were also blacksmiths, bronze smiths, carpenters, thatchers, leather workers and potters. Wine and fine pottery were imported as well as millstones. By the 9th century there was a royal mint in the town. Suthhamtun suffered severely in the Danish raids of the 9th and 10th centuries. The Danes sacked the town several times leading to a period of decline.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40065	Following the end of Roman rule, Anglo-Saxons established themselves in "an open meadow by the Tame" which they called "Tomworðig". Tamworthige initially contained a "large hall for public gatherings" as well as individual homes and agricultural buildings such as stables and granaries. The Tamworthige settlers quickly became wealthy -- in time it became the capital of Mercia until the town was sacked by the Danes in 874. It remained a ruin until 913, when Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and Lady of the Mercians, rebuilt the town and constructed a burh to defend it against further Danish invaders. She made Tamworthige her principal residence and died there in 918.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40066	Tintagol (Cornish meaning "village on a mountain") is a village situated on the Atlantic coast in Cerneu. History and legend are inseparable at Tintagol. It was an important stronghold, and a residence of rulers of Cornwall during 5th and 7th centuries AD. It was memories of this seat of Cornish kings that inspired the 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth to name it in his 'History of the Kings of Britain' as the place where King Arthur was conceived, with the help of Merlin. Beneath the castle by the water's edge is a 100 metres long cave formed by erosion. Tennyson made this place famous when he described waves bringing the infant Arthur to the shore, where he was plucked out by Merlin and carried to safety.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40067	From the 300s the area became an important centre for the people of the Verturiones, who went on to establish the Pictish Kingdom of Fortriu: with, very probably, Tor in Duine as its Northern capital. Over the next 500 years what evolved here was a large fortress, covering an area of 7.5 acres. In 884 Tor in Duine was captured by Sigurd the Powerful, the Norse Earl of Orkney. The indications are that Sigurd rebuilt the fortress and it then became a centre of Norse power in Moray. Under the Norse the fortress became known by the Danish name Burghe, which much later became Burghe-head. The Norse were eventually expelled from this part of the country by the Scots in 1010.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40068	During the 9th century the shores of south-east Ériu were often ravaged by Danish expeditions. At the outset, these incursions took place only during the summer months, the raiders returning home with their spoils at the onset of winter, but later the Vikings built a permanent encampment. This place in particular provided a splendid anchorage. It was the lowest point at which the river could at that time be forded. Above all, the site could easily be defended. The marshes also extended westwards round the back of the site of the old town. Only on the west itself were substantial fortifications necessary. This was Vedrafjordr in its infancy, a Danish stronghold, subject to constant harassment by the Irish outside the walls.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40069	Veisafjǫrðr ("inlet of the mud flats") was founded by the Vikings around 800 AD. According to a story recorded in the Dindsenchas, the name "Loch Garman" comes from a man named Garman mac Bomma Licce who was chased to the river mouth and drowned as a consequence of stealing the queen's crown from Temair during the feast of Samhain. For about three hundred years it was a Viking town, a city state, largely independent and owing only token dues to the Irish kings of Leinster. However, in May 1169 Veisafjǫrðr was besieged by Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster and his Norman ally, Robert Fitz-Stephen. The Norse inhabitants resisted fiercely, until the Bishop of Ferns persuaded them to accept a settlement with Dermot.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40070	Waerincwicum began as a Saxon settlement. The name is derived from two Saxon words, weir and wic, which meant houses or settlement. In the 10th century Waerincwicum was made into a fortified town or burh. The Saxons created a network of fortified settlements called burhs across their kingdom. In the event of a Danish attack all the men from the area could gather together in the local burh, however Waerincwicum was more than a fortress. It also had weekly markets and a mint. Saxon Waerincwicum was a flourishing little town.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40071	A Celtic tribe lived in the area of Werham around 400 AD, however the modern settlement was founded by the Saxons. They conquered East Dorset in the mid-7th century and about 700 AD a Saxon named St Aldhelm founded a nunnery on the site around which a village would develop. It was called 'wer ham', the settlement by the weir. In 876 Werham was captured by an army of Danes. King Alfred arrived with a Saxon army and made a treaty, temporarily convincing the Danes to withdraw. During Alfred's military reforms Werham was made into a burh, however Werham was more than just a fort. It was also a flourishing little market town containing a royal mint, showing it was quite an important place.	true
advice_levels_onscreen_text_40072	Wintanceaster began in 70 AD as a Roman regional capital with its streets laid out in a grid pattern. In the middle of the town was the forum. This was a market place lined with public buildings, shops, and temples for worship. The city was later given stone walls with suburbs outside the walls. The city declined in the 4th century but was revived amidst the Saxon invasions and became formally known as "Wintan-ceaster" ("Fort Venta") in Old English. The present form of the city dates to reconstruction in the late 9th century, when King Alfred obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defense against the Vikings. The city's first mint appears to date from this period.	true
