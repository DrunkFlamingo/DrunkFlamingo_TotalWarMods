incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_athelingaeg	Cadbury Castle, Athelingaeg	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_athelingaeg	Cadbury Castle is a Bronze and Iron Age hillfort in the English county of Somersaete. The earliest settlement on the site is represented by pits and post holes dated with Neolithic pottery and flints. These are the remains of a small agricultural settlement which was unenclosed. A stone enclosure was constructed around 300 BC with timber revetting, and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Though it fell into ruin after Rome withdrew from the region, there was significant activity between 1010 and 1020AD, in which the hill was reoccupied for use as a temporary Saxon mint, standing in for that at Ilchester.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_wiht	The Needles, Wiht	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_wiht	The Needles is a row of three distinctive stacks of chalk that rise about 30m out of the sea off the western extremity of the Isle of Wight. The Needles' pointed shape is a result of their unusual geology. The strata have been so heavily folded during the Alpine Orogeny that the chalk is near vertical. Just off the end of the Needles formation is the Shingles, a shifting shoal of pebbles just beneath the waves. The Shingles is approximately three miles in length. Many ships have been wrecked on the Shingles.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_cissanbyrig	The Uffington White Horse, Cissanbyrig	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_cissanbyrig	The White Horse, which measures 111 metres from the tip of its tail to its ear, has been dated to the later Bronze Age or Iron Age, between 1740 and 210BC. It may have been a territorial marker or a fertility symbol – the horse is thought to represent a tribe, perhaps connected with the builders of Uffington Castle. The shape of the horse has changed over the centuries. The loss of shape has been caused by slippage of the top soil and by repeated recutting. The head currently has a prominent ‘eye’, and tusk-like ‘beak’ at its mouth.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_wiltun	Stonehenge, Wiltun	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_wiltun	Stonehenge served as place of burial and ritual for early Celtic folk from its beginning to its zenith in the mid third millennium B.C. The importance of the Stonehenge is underscored by the immense effort involved in moving them a long distance—some were as long as ten feet and weighed four tons and were cut from the Preseli Mountains in southwest Wales, 225 metres from Stonehenge. The most likely route would have required traversing some 400km —with the stones floated on rafts, then pulled overland by teams of men and oxen or rolled on logs—along the south coast of Wales, crossing the Avon River near Bristol and then heading southeast to the Salisbury Plain. 	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_hagustaldes	Hadrian's Wall, Hagustaldes	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_hagustaldes	Built on the orders of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and located in Great Britain, Hadrian’s Wall was a defensive fortification that marked the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire for three centuries. The wall measured 117km in length and stretched from coast to coast across present-day northern England, between Wallsend in the east to Bowness-on-Solway in the west. Construction likely started around A.D. 122, after Hadrian visited the Roman province then known as Britannia, and it’s thought to have taken an army of 15,000 men at least six years to complete it. The majority of the wall was made from stone, although some portions were fabricated from turf.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_oxnaford	The Rollright Stones, Oxnaford	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_oxnaford	Traditionally a monarch and his courtiers petrified by a witch, the Rollright Stones consist of three groups: the King's Men stone circle; the Whispering Knights burial chamber; and the single King Stone. They span nearly 2,000 years of Neolithic and Bronze Age development. The legend behind the Rollright Stones in the Cotswolds centres around an Iron Age king who one day set out with his army to conquer the whole of England. Whilst marching through the Cotswolds and over Rollright Hill, the king met a witch who told him that if he could see the local village of Long Compton after seven strides then she would make him King of England.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_linns	Newgrange, Linns	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_linns	Newgrange is a Stone Age monument built about 3200BC during the Neolithic period, which makes it older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids. Newgrange is a large circular mound with a stone passageway and chambers inside. The mound is ringed by 'kerbstones' engraved with artwork. The Neolithic people who built the monument were farmers, growing crops and raising animals such as cattle in the area where their settlements were located; they had not yet developed metal, so all their tools would have been made out of stone, wood, antler or bone. Newgrange contains various examples of Megalithic Art including circles, spirals, arcs, chevrons and lozenges, radials.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_cnodba	The Hill of Tara, Cnodba	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_cnodba	The Hill of Tara, known as Temair in gaeilge, was once the ancient seat of power in Ériu – 142 kings are said to have reigned there in prehistoric and historic times. In ancient Irish religion and mythology Temair was the sacred place of dwelling for the gods, and was the entrance to the otherworld. Saint Patrick is said to have come to Tara to confront the ancient religion of the pagans at its most powerful site. One interpretation of the name Tara says that it means a "place of great prospect" and indeed on a clear day it is claimed that features in half the counties of Ériu can be seen from atop Tara. 	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_rudglann	The Pillar of Eliseg, Rudglann	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_rudglann	The Pillar of Eliseg is a 9th century tribute to Eliseg, a king of Powys, by his great-grandson,  Cyngen ap Cadell. The inscriptions beings with: "And that Concenn, great-grandson of Eliseg, erected this stone for his great-grandfather Eliseg † The same Eliseg, who joined together the inheritance of Powys . . . throughout nine years out of the power of the Angles with his sword and with fire. † Whosoever shall read this hand-inscribed stone, let him give a blessing on the soul of Eliseg."	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_inber_nise	Loch Ness, Nise	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_inber_nise	Loch Ness is a large, deep, freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands extending for approximately 37 kilometres southwest of Inber Nise. Loch Ness is known as the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as "Nessie"), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_bebbanburg	Lindisfarne, Bebbanburg	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_bebbanburg	Lindisfarne is intimately connected with the history of Christianity in Britain. In 635 the Northumbrian king, Oswald (reigned 634–42), summoned an Irish monk named Aidan from Iona – the island-monastery off the south-west coast of what is now Scotland – to be bishop of his kingdom. Oswald granted Aidan and his companions the small tidal island of Lindisfarne on which to found a monastery. Oswald’s gift of Lindisfarne, 9km up the coast from Bamburgh, to the monks from Iona enabled them to establish a monastery and a bishopric in the political heart of the Northumbrian kingdom. The ultimate success of the monks’ mission, together with the long-term wealth of their monastery, was founded on their proximity to the royal dynasty of Bernicia.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_dun_sebuirgi	The Giant's Causeway, Dun Sebuirgi	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_dun_sebuirgi	The Giant's Causeway is an area in Northern Ériu of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption. According to legend, the columns are the remains of a causeway built by a giant. The story goes that the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn MacCool), from the Fenian Cycle of Gaelic mythology, was challenged to a fight by the Scottish giant Benandonner. Fionn accepted the challenge and built the causeway across the North Channel so that the two giants could meet. 	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_blascona	The Ring of Brodgar, Blascona	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_blascona	The spellbinding stone circle - the Ring of Brodgar - is arguably the most iconic symbol of Orkney's prehistoric past. It is a site of ritual and ceremony, and hauntingly beautiful. Built in a true circle, the Ring of Brodgar is thought to have been originally composed of 60 individual stones, though presently there are 27 intact. The stones themselves are of red sandstone and vary in height from 7-15 feet. The stones are surrounded by a large circular ditch or henge. 	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_snotingaham	Sherwood Forest, Snotingaham	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_snotingaham	Sherwood Forest is a royal forest in Snotingham, famous by its historic association with the legend of Robin Hood. The name 'Sherwood' was first recorded in 958AD when it was called Sciryuda, meaning 'the woodland belonging to the shire'. It became a Royal hunting forest after the Norman invasion of 1066, and was popular with many Norman kings, particularly King John and Edward I. In the 1200s, popularly thought to be the time of Robin Hood, Sherwood covered about 100,000 acres, which was a fifth of the entire county of Nottinghamshire. The main London to York road, the Great North Way, ran straight through Sherwood, and travellers were often at the mercy of robbers living outside of the law. Hence the name 'outlaw'.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_bodmine	Trethevy Quoit, Bodmine	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_bodmine	This well-preserved and impressive Neolithic 'dolmen' burial chamber stands 2.7 metres high. There are five standing stones, surmounted by a huge capstone. It is far from certain that these structures were tombs rather than multipurpose shrines. The presence of the dead is no guarantee of the original usage, as is shown by medieval churches: these contain tombs and are surrounded by graves, yet they were built primarily as places where the living could worship. It may be that in prehistoric times the ancestral dead were considered to be mediators between the community and its gods, and that places like this were an important interface between these two worlds.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_sancte_ye	The Merry Maidens, Sancte Ye	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_sancte_ye	This late Stone/early Bronze Age (2500-1500BC) stone circle is renowned for both its beauty and the stories connected to it. The origin story evolved that the Merry Maidens were local girls who broke the rules on the Sabbath and were turned to stone for dancing, the equally sinful musicians, now the large pillars known as the Pipers, being petrified in nearby fields. 	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_ros_ailithir	Drombeg Stone Circle, Ros Ailithir	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_ros_ailithir	Drombeg means "the small ridge." The circle is sometimes called the Druid’s Altar because some believe that it was a place for ceremonies. Next to the stone circle are two stone huts and one is probably the remains of a fulacht fiadh, an ancient cooking place surrounded by hut dwellings. The communal cooking area consists of a stone trough, hearth and well that was surrounded by a low rock wall. The cooking arrangement was an ingenious way to prepare large amounts of food for the people who lived in the adjoining huts while consuming the least amount of energy. The trough could hold around 70 gallons of water from the well. Stones heated in the hearth fire would then be rolled under the trough or placed inside to bring the water to a boil. The hot water could then be used to cook meat or other foods for several hours without needing to be reheated.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_hripum	The Brimham Rocks, Hripum	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_hripum	The Brimham Rocks are a collection of rocks scattered across 50 acres of moor in North Yorkshire. Over time nature has carved these strange rocks into weird and wonderful shapes, earning them nicknames such as the Sphinx, the Eagle, Idol rock, the Turtle, the Camel and the Dancing Bear. The rock shapes were most likely formed by erosion during the last glacial period, which occurred from around 110,000 to 10,000 years ago. Without plant cover the sand-blasting effect wore down the softer layers of rock, creating unusual shapes such as Idol Rock, on which a giant curved rock balances improbably atop a tiny plinth.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_aporcrosan	Old Man of Stoer, Aporcrosan	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_aporcrosan	The Old Man of Stoer is a dramatic sea stack in the north of Sutherland. The Old Man (not to be confused with the Old Man of Storr rock needle on the Isle of Skye) is 60 metres high and composed of Torridonian sandstone.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_cathair_commain	Poulnabrone Dolmen, Cathair Commain	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_cathair_commain	Poulnabrone Dolmen ("Hole of the Quern Stones") is a portal tomb as it has two large portal stones standing on either side of an entrance capped with a massive sloping capstone. The entrance faces north and is almost 2 metres high. A second stone which lies on the ground at the rear of the monument was likely a second capstone which would have fitted in under the main capstone and covered the back of the structure. This part collapsed at some unknown time in the past. The tomb was built on limestone pavement and surrounded by a low mound of rocks. This mound of rocks would have added support to the upright stones which are otherwise only supported by the weight of the capstone. It is supposed that that that Poulnabrone was erected in the neothilic age as a doorway between this world and the next based upon artifacts and skeletal remains that can be found by digging around the base.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_brideport	The Maiden Castle, Brideport	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_brideport	Maiden Castle is the largest and most complex Iron Age hillfort in Britain. At first, the fort was home to a small, self-sufficient community, but in the following 400 years it became the pre-eminent settlement in southern Dorset. At the height of its occupation, the fort was densely populated and there were many roundhouses. These had central hearths, large pits for storing grain and were often circled by drainage gullies. Textile production and metalworking were also taking place here. In the middle Iron Age, the layout of the interior of the hillfort was reorganised. Once randomly arranged houses were now built in regimented rows, with traffic guided along roads. This reorganisation suggests some control existed over social life within the fort. Later in the Iron Age, this organised system broke down, and the focus of the settlement became once again the eastern end of the hillfort. At this time, there was increasing trade with the continent, and specialised industries such as metal-working were becoming very important. Within a few decades of the arrival of the Romans, the hillfort was abandoned. The Romans established the town of Dorchester (Durnovaria) to the north-east as the regional capital of the Durotriges.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_tintagol	Hurlers Stone Circles, Tintagol	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_tintagol	The Hurlers Stone Circles, a series of three stone circles aligned in a row, are probably the best examples of ceremonial circles in the south west. Said to have been hurled by an angry St. Cleer in response to violation of the Lord's Sabbath, these three large stone circles are built close together and vary in size from 32 to 41 metres across. The circles probably date to the early Bronze Age. They are oriented on a roughly NNE by SSW axis. From end to end the alignment is 162 metres in length. It seems likely that the stone circles formed part of a processional route involving other local monuments, with which there are several known or suspected alignments. The northern 2 circles align perfectly with Rillaton Barrow burial mound, while the southernmost pair of circles align with a round cairn to the south-west. Another stone circle and stone row are aligned at right angles to the central circle.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_laewe	Cissbury Ring, Laewe	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_laewe	Cissbury Ring is a Sussex landmark on the South Downs. During the Neolithic period, bands of hunters are thought to have used the South Downs as a vantage point for spotting animal herds. The Neolithic period also saw the development of settlements in the surrounding area as people banded together to clear woodland, plant crops and domesticate animals. An extensive flint mining operation was carved out on the southern side of the hill evidence of which can still be seen. Agricultural settlements continued to grow during the early Bronze Age when Cissbury appears to have been used as a ritual burial ground. Two round barrows have been identified here. This type of burial mound marked a change from multiple interments in a long barrow to individual burials. The Iron Age hill fort was constructed around 400BC and was used for defence for around 300 years before finally being left to ruin.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_dofere	White Cliffs of Dover, Dofere	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_dofere	The White Cliffs of Dover are part of the coastline of Kent at the point where Britain is closest to continental Europe. On a clear day they are visible from the French coast. The cliff face, which reaches a height of 110 metres, owes its striking appearance to its composition of chalk accented by streaks of black flint. Julius Caesar wrote about these cliffs in the Commentarii De Bello Gallico, Commentaries on the Gallic War, said to be the earliest surviving eye-witness account of Britain. In the account, Caesar's first impression of Britain was of "a wild island with giant natural fortification". In 55BC he arrived with two legions of soldiers looking for a good place to disembark. Instead he faced the towering cliffs and "armed forces of the enemy" on them. They were able to hurl weapons down on the soldiers, forcing Caesar up the coast so his army could land on a more open beach. And so the cliffs went on record for their significance as a natural fortress and something that impeded Caesar's invasion.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_werham	Durdle Door, Werham	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_werham	The Durdle Door rock arch rises out of the sea on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, England and is one of the most famous land forms in the world. It was created when the sea pierced through the Portland limestone around 10,000 years ago. Looking west over the beach, isolated stacks out at sea show where an older coastline once lay. This part of the coast is formed from merged bays and shows how Lulworth Cove and Stair Hole may look in several thousand years time. By following the natural cliff path down to Durdle Door beach, or the steps to Man O’War beach, the tilted Purbeck Beds are clearly visible. At the base of the chalk cliffs a number of caves can be seen which have been carved out by the sea (wave cut notches).	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_alt_clut	Dumbarton Rock, Alt Clut	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_alt_clut	Dumbarton Rock is a volcanic plug of basalt created 334 million years ago, with the softer exterior of the volcano having weathered away. At least as far back as the Iron Age, this has been the site of a strategically important settlement as evidenced by archaeological finds. In 756 AD, the first (and second) losses of Dumbarton Rock were recorded. A joint force of Picts and Northumbrians captured the fortress after a siege, only to lose it again a few days later. By 870, it was home to a tightly packed British settlement, which served as a fortress and as the capital of Alt Clut. In 871, the Irish-based Viking kings Amlaíb and Ímar laid siege to Dumbarton Rock. The fortress fell in four months, after its water supply failed. The kings are recorded to have returned to Ériu with 200 ships and a host of British, English, and Pictish captives. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_wonder_discovered_sancte_ye1	Mên-an-Tol, Sancte Ye	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_wonder_discovered_sancte_ye1	The Mên-an-Tol monument consists of four stones: one fallen, two uprights, and between these a circular one, 1.3m in diameter, pierced by a hole about half its size in diameter. Holed stones are found in many parts of British Isles as well as in other countries of the world; together with holy wells they have retained the ideas and customs associated with them more tenaciously than any other type of ancient sites. Traditional rituals at Mên-an-Tol involved passing naked children three times through the holed stone and then drawing them along the grass three times in an easterly direction. This was thought to cure scrofula (a form of tuberculosis) and rickets. Adults seeking relief from rheumatism, spine troubles or ague were advised to crawl through the hole nine times against the sun. The holed stone also had prophetic qualities and, according to local folklore: "If two brass pins are carefully laid across each other on the top edge of the stone, any question put to the rock will be answered by the pins acquiring, through some unknown agency, a peculiar motion."	true
