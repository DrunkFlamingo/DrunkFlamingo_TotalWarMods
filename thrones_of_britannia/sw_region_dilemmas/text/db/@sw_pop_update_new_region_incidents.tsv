incidents_localised_description_sw_foreign_dead_wife_vik_reg_aberffro	Word reaches your ears of trouble stirring in your Kingdom. A Viking came home to his wife after a season fishing overseas, only to find that she had perished in his absence and was buried in the local churchyard. Dismayed and distraught, the widower dug up his late wifeâ€™s body from the cemetery so that he could give her the proper rites in the traditions of their own people. Sincere as he may have been, disturbing hallowed ground is a grave sin and his actions have greatly disturbed the locals in the region. The situation is contained for now, but we should be wary of further problems caused by the presence of foreigners in our lands.	true
