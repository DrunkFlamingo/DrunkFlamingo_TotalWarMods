incidents_localised_description_sw_normans_invasion_far_away	My liege, word from the south brings new of a massive fleet, bristling with blades, bows and lances, drifting towards the shores of Britannia in the South. The armies of the south are powerful, but these forces from the continent have been fighting for decades. We should watch developments carefully, for it is doubtful that the Conqueror's ambitions will retire in England.	false
incidents_localised_description_sw_normans_invasion_harrying	In response to our resistance to their conquests, the conqueror has ordered his generals to begin Harrying our villages. This cruelty will slow down their advance, but without our intervention it will be brutally effective in crushing resistance.	false
incidents_localised_description_sw_normans_conqueror_survives	As our soldiers surge forward and the Normans fall back, the joy of victory is stolen by the sight of royal guards riding across the field in the company of the Duke's banners. The day is ours, but the conqueror lives on. 	false

The day is ours, and the decaying bodies of would-be Kings now feed the soil of a great new Kingdom.	false
incidents_localised_description_sw_norse_invasion_arrives	The greed of Haraldr Sigurðarson knows no bounds! Having recently been foiled in his attempts to conquer the Danish crown for himself, Haraldr now sets his eyes upon Jorvik, and leads an immense fleet of Vikings to establish his Court there. His invasion will bring chaos, and we should watch him closely, for his ambitions are unlikely to be sated by Jorvik alone.	false
incidents_localised_description_sw_norse_conqueror_dies	As the last of his warriors melt away, an arrow pierces Haraldr Sigurðarson in the throat.

He has failed, he knows it, and he blinks in silent acknowledgment of this fact, and so passes Haraldr Sigurðarson, King of Norway from this world.	false
incidents_localised_description_sw_norse_invasion_attacks	The greed of Haraldr Sigurðarson knows no bounds! Having recently been foiled in his attempts to conquer the Danish crown for himself, Haraldr now sets his eyes upon our shores and prepares a vast army that will force England to submit his rule, adding to his Empire of the North Sea. This is our land and we shall not surrender. We must defeat him by any means necessary.	false
