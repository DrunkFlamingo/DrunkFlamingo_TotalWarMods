technologies_short_description_vik_civ_army_1	Hunting was a subject considered worthy of the attention of the greatest of men. Religious symbolism was common; the hart or the unicorn was often associated with Christ, but the hunt itself could equally be seen as the Christian's quest for truth and salvation. In the more secular literature the hunter pursuing his quarry was often used as a symbol of the knight's struggle for his lady's favor. Thus, becoming an accomplished hunter was one of the noblest achievements a man could possess to distinguish himself among his fellow man.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_army_2	Travel in Medieval Europe was often difficult, dangerous, costly and time consuming. Important people such as statesmen and clergy had little time or inclination to travel with news or messages and so, would employ trusted messengers to act on their behalf. During particularly sensitive times, such as war, messages were often sent in coded form, or hidden about the person of a messenger who would adopt an innocent disguise, such as that of a pilgrim. Information could be hidden in clothing, a walking staff or even a person’s shoes. 	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_army_3	In a time when people owed their tribal or clan loyalty to their kin, cattle raiding, feuding, murder, arson and pillaging were all common occurrences. Reiving (raiding or plundering) was planned like a military operation and could involve gangs of armed men and last for days. More modest raids might involve no more than a short moonlit ride, a quick plunder from a small farm followed by a dash home for breakfast. The Reiver came from every social class from labourer to peer of the realm. He was a skilled horseman and fine guerrilla soldier.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_army_4	Campaigning armies were not known to be kind to areas they marched through, even to their own countrysides. “Foraging and living off the land” often included purchasing, requisitioning, or even stealing supplies from the locals. More prepared rulers would often set aside grain stores specifically for their marching armies, as was done in Roman times. Maintaining discipline was always a challenge. Unchecked marauders often caused diplomatic disputes, such as a vassal subordinates levies looting an ally of their liege.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_army_5	Soldiers built their fortune on aggressive acts of looting and ransoming hostages. Precious loot included coinage, family members of nobles, precious metals, jewelry, weapons, armor, clothing, horses, and, most importantly, food. Some Medieval battles even had their outcomes changed by the temptation to loot baggage trains before the battle was truly over!	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_army_6	Many nobles began as battle companions of the king, but as time passed and kingdoms grew large, they became the rulers of the land they held in trust for their lord and were trusted to summon men to war when needed. During the Saxon Wars of 772-804AD, the pagan Saxon king Widukind, in his attempt to defeat Charlemagne was able to incense his nobles to stand behind him against this fiercely Christian threat from the west. Alongside an alliance with the Frisians, Widukind granted many of his warriors autonomous control of their regions in order to incentivise them to drive back the Carolingians.	true

technologies_short_description_vik_civ_farm_1	Water powered mills have been in use since Roman times, but the late 9th century saw the rise of a newly designed watermill consisting of a horizontally mounted wheel that would drive a pair of grindstones directly without the intervention of gears. The invention enabled the first large scale forges to appear throughout Medieval Europe. Indeed, a large portion of the six thousand mills, recorded in the Domesday Book of England of 1086, were of this type.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_farm_3	It isn't necessary to understand microbiological processes in order to correctly observe that wet food left in open air will quickly start to smell and attract bugs. Salting was the most common way to preserve virtually any type of meat or fish as it drew out the moisture and killed the bacteria. Grains like rye and wheat were dried in the sun before being stored in a dry place.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_farm_5	From the times of Charlemagne, farmers in Europe transitioned from a two-field crop rotation to a three-field crop rotation. In this system farmers would divide their land into three sections, sowing grains in two plots and allowing the third plot to rest. On this schedule, each section lay fallow and recovered some of its nutrients and organic matter every third year before it was again sown with wheat.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_farm_2	As Europe shifted slowly to a Feudal system, the peasants interacted less with the King directly and became more dependent on their governing Lord on whose land they lived. Those Lords (who would later become the knight classes) began to foster a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land, and thus their Lordly title enabled them to directly influence the social, political, and economic affairs within their estate.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_farm_4	The division of British territory into counties most likely started with the Romans, who divided the country into regions according to natural features such as rivers or mountains. It was the kingdom of Wessex that first subdivided its lands further, into shires and boroughs - a style that soon caught on as Mercia ascended to a position of influence over the other Anglo-Saxons. And although the word has fallen out of use in favour of counties, their influence can still be found in county names such as Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Lancashire.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_farm_6	Feudalism was a combination of legal, economic and military customs that flourished in medieval Europe between the 9th and 15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of restructuring societal relationships between Lord and peasant, in which the unfree peasantry (serfs) were contracted to toil on units of land (fiefs) owned by the Lord; the Lord owned all the fruits of their labour, and in exchange provided military protection.	true

technologies_short_description_vik_civ_industry_1	During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline as a result of adopting much less efficient methods than those used in Roman times. By the end of the 9th century, however, economic and social conditions started to favour more advanced metallurgy practices and a slow but steady general progress was noted as metalworkers became more skilled at the refinement processes (such as adding carbon to strengthen iron).	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_industry_2	Oral and ritual elements had always played an important role in early contractual arrangements (the statement of intention, volo, and the oath of fidelity, which might specify the terms of the contract), but written charters became an increasingly important tool from the ninth-century onwards. Written contract had certainly existed previously but it wasn't as common to consistently record contracts in this manner. By the end of the Middle Ages it would be almost unthinkable for a lord not to keep track of his major economic dues through written record.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_industry_3	The early Roman Road network’s primary function was to allow the rapid movement of troops and military supplies, but it also provided vital infrastructure for trade and the transport of goods. Roman roads remained in use as core trunk roads for centuries after the Romans withdrew from Britain in 410 AD. Systematic construction of paved highways did not resume in England until the 18th century, though certain learned engineers could learn the proper steps for maintaining and repairing the Roman Roads.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_industry_4	With the advent of written contracts also came the gradual decline of “honour” – i.e. living according to the “word” of the agreement rather than the “spirit”. Even in early codified law it became clear that legal code can be manipulated in such a way as to give one party an unfair advantage over the other. This sort of system naturally selects for those who have the means and the leverage to play word games against those who do not.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_industry_5	Cupellation is a refining process where materials are exposed to very high temperatures and have controlled operations to separate noble metals ( gold and silver)  from base metals (lead, copper, zinc, arsenic, antimony or bismuth) present in the ore. Large-scale cupellation became possible as soon as the necessary large-scale heating processes became available through the advent of better mills.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_industry_6	Emissaries have been used throughout history as diplomats, representatives and negotiators, anointed to speak on behalf of the King. English kings ensured their agent’s safety by issuing a safeconduct which worked in much the same as the 'king's badge' (later a livery). Nevertheless emissaries were still occasionally robbed by lay people merely on account of their wealth during their long travels, but this most often had no political end and was purely economical.	true

technologies_short_description_vik_civ_leader_1	Built atop the tradition of tribal communes and chieftain's feasting halls, the “civilised” courts and councils of Saxon and Viking kings were often places of revelry, where feasting and celebrating took place. The king also called together chieftains to meet in a gathering known as a 'thing' (in the Nordic countries) or a 'folkmoot' (in Anglo-Saxon ones). This was a place where grievances could be aired and issues of general policy and direction could be discussed.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_leader_2	The laws of the Anglo-Saxon people were inspired by the 'leges barbarorum', which were the early law codes that governed most Germanic societies. However, Anglo-Saxon laws were written in their native tongue as opposed to Latin, and were generally decided by committee. Anglo-Saxon law was first codified into Old English from its oral roots by King Aethelberht of Kent, "according to the examples of the Romans", which most historians take to mean as written down, rather than citing Roman legal precedent. 	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_leader_3	For many pagan kingdoms, the concept of money was far more fluid than was the case in the western, Christian kingdoms. If you needed a cow, for instance, but had nothing to exchange, then precious metals and what was known as hacksilver (bits and pieces of random and broken silver), could be traded instead. As the Vikings came into contact with other nations, such as the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, they were exposed to minted coins for the first time and saw the propaganda value of controlling the flow of money and stamping the king's head upon each and every coin.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_leader_4	By the 9th century AD, European kings could no longer rely on voluntary support to fuel expensive military campaigns, forcing them to look elsewhere for the finances to raise and support their armies. For many peoples, their most lucrative assets were agricultural, making farms an obvious target for additional taxation in times of need – many kings were known to have levied taxes on agricultural production to pay for the support of their armies. This practice continued well into the Middle Ages; known as 'tithes', the taxable sum was a tenth of the whole - whether that be money or goods.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_leader_5	Roman Emperors, particularly before the Empire's adoption of Christianity, believed themselves to be chosen by the gods to rule. Kingship itself was often equated with the role of a judge or high priest, with the leader of a nation often also being its religious head, or at least a powerful representation of state religion for his subject people. Christian Kings were generally thought to be "above earthly authority" and chosen by God to rule over their people.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_leader_6	Royal charters are tools used by monarchs to create institutions or to confer titles and powers upon individuals (although they are separate from letters of appointment). In a more modern context, they are most commonly employed to establish organisations or to ratify city status. Medieval Kings ofted used royal decrees to shape civil status according to their pious, Christian vision. 	true

technologies_short_description_vik_civ_market_1	Taverns could be found anywhere from the largest city to the smallest country Thorpe as drinking was an important part of medieval life. In towns, taverns were commonly owned by brewers of beer or winemakers (vintners). In places like London, the guild was able to secure a monopoly, making them the exclusive distributors of alcoholic beverages. People would amass every evening at one of these houses and quite often drink themselves silly.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_market_2	Eventually, no matter where they came from, goods had to end up at market in order to be sold. As such, markets sprang up close to natural harbours, and where rivers forked or roads met - and naturally settlements followed. Although the marketplaces themselves became semi-permanent spaces, what was sold very much depended on what was available in quantity, what could be transported, or what caught the eye of a particular trader at a particular time. Gradually, over time, settlements grew up around markets as it made sense to live close to your means of income.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_market_3	English coins have been in usage since 600AD, at least according to carbon-dating performed on the treasure hoard found at Sutton Hoo in 1939. The early coins, ‘sceat’, were small, thick coins made entirely of silver, and decorated with a wide variety of impressive artworks of Celtic, Germanic and pagan designs, like animals, crosses and many scenes of nature. In the 10th century precise weights and measurements were utilized to create a more uniform coinage that made it more difficult for unscrupulous merchants to game the system. 	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_market_4	By the 7th century AD the Frankish kings began revitalising trade in northern Europe with a fair at St. Denis, which connected cities across the northern continent, mainly via old Roman roads and the network of rivers that lattice Europe. Ports and river villages began to become important trade hubs once again. Securing open trading rights opens merchants up to vital trade networks, which they wouldn’t have otherwise had access to.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_market_5	Life in a royal palace, and at court, required a great deal of smiles, manners and etiquette, yet these were often façades to hide the danger and subterfuge that lay beneath. Royal courts were a battlefield of intrigue and politics - power was everything, and losing power was as good as a death sentence. Although palaces were hubs of learning and enlightenment, attracting scientists and musicians, darker dealings in the shadows inevitably came to dominate the lives of the courtiers.\\n	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_market_6	Trade and commerce in the medieval world developed to such an extent that even relatively small communities had access to weekly markets. Large fairs were organised by large estate owners, town councils, and some churches and monasteries, who, granted a license to do so by their sovereign, hoped to gain revenue from stall holder fees and boost the local economy as shoppers used peripheral services. International trade had been present since Roman times but improvements in transportation and banking, as well as the economic development of northern Europe, caused a boom in the ninth century.	true

technologies_short_description_vik_civ_religion_1	In the British Isles, a distinct style of manuscript art emerged, called 'insular' art. Insular art is much more dense and imaginative than illuminations from the continent, with spirals and complicated geometric shapes appearing - possibly due to Celtic influences. The Germanic influence of the Anglo-Saxons also saw pagan motifs - animals and nature - featuring heavily. The Book of Kells, an Irish version of the Bible from approximately 800AD, is one of the most intricately decorated examples of insular art to have survived to the present day, with entire pages of vibrant colours, intricate shapes and complicated patternwork.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_religion_2	The music of the Christian Church comes from its Jewish forebears, as indeed do many of its rituals and rites. Although debated by scholars, some think the Psalms - integral parts of the Jewish faith - are the origin of both Jewish and Catholic religious song. However, in the middle of the 1st century AD, singing was frowned upon until the development of the church organ in approximately the 7th century, not long after the introduction of the Gregorian chant. Although commonly thought to be a Carolingian invention; a melding together of Roman and Gallic chants, legend attributes it to Pope St. Gregory the Great. Gregorian chant is known for its melisma - the singing of a single syllable over several musical notes - and its characteristic fluctuating melody. 	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_religion_3	As the most studied book of its age, the Bible was dutifully and exquisitely transcribed in Latin by the monastic orders. In the early medieval period, papyrus had fallen out of use as a writing surface in favour of the more durable and lasting vellum (parchment), which was carefully prepared before being written upon. Calfskin was soaked in water and lime and left to dry for several days. Afterwards, excess hair was removed and the skin framed and pressed. Completing the work, the sheet of vellum was rubbed with a flat object to allow ease of writing.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_religion_4	Along with the advent of Christianity came the dying out of barrows and grave goods, with people naturally selecting for the simpler requirements set forth by Christian doctrine to the elaborate rituals favoured by some of the older Pagans. As the Feudal classes began to take shape the traditions of noble families purchasing family plots also became more common. At the cemetery of Apple Down in Sussex, four-post structures were discovered, mostly situated over cremations, and the excavators theorised that these were the remains of small, roofed huts that contained the cremated deposits of a single family.	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_religion_5	As the role of the Church expanded (often even into state affairs) it became necessary for the activities of the Church to expand beyond the regular ecclesiastical authorities and volunteers, with the Church adopting its own form of contracts and fulltime labourers beyond the authority of the King.  	true
technologies_short_description_vik_civ_religion_6	Monasticism was a life of seclusion and strict adherence to Christianity’s fundamental tenets - study, prayer and labour. Everything else was considered unimportant and simplified accordingly. Monasteries became the centre of the communities they served, as monks were well versed in all manner of skills with which to aid the local populace as part of their Christian duty. Monks took it upon themselves to teach the townsfolk the Psalms (as well as basic grammar and arithmetic), transforming monasteries to  not just being the main cultural centres of the kingdom, but also the primary source of basic education.	true
