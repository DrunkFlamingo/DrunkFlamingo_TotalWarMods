Among your peers you have become an intellectual giant. In the dark chambers of your mind, however, the discomforting truth is that as one learns more about the world around him it becomes quite larger than what it was before.

dilemmas_localised_description_sw_traits_grooming_heir	Your heir is destined to inherit the Kingdom but he does not yet look the part!

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_heathen_pagan_choice	The robed clergymen flee from your soldiers like a warren of rabbits. Most are left alone but those who are too ill or too fat to flee are quickly cut down or are bound in fetters to be sold later on the market. The burning of their sanctuary produces a pungent mix of burning wood and incense -- the scattered remains of their parchments float lazily above the flames of the buildings. Your men drag a man towards you who is dressed slightly more extravagantly than the rest.... he must be one of the high priests.	true

dilemmas_localised_title_shield_heathen_legendary_bearskin	Berserker	true
dilemmas_localised_description_shield_heathen_legendary_bearskin	As the darkness of the evening falls on the treetops some of the berserkirs in your army invite you to a small ritual site at the edge of the woods. The bonfire roars as the GyÃ°ja takes an engraved knife and begins her work of opening the throats of many different animals, especially horses. She instructs her followers to catch the blood from the sacrificed animals in bowls and twigs are used to spatter the blood on altars, walls and other participants standing nearby.

dilemmas_localised_title_shield_faithful_charitable_choice	Charitable	true
dilemmas_localised_description_shield_faithful_charitable_choice	Looking on your armies causes you to reflect on the state of life for your men. They work all day every day for a loaf of bread and a pot to piss in. Their families die in sickness and hunger, and yet their King still asks them to give up their lives in battle. But when that land is threatened, something stirs in their chest that causes them to turn out and fight. It can only be love. From wretch to warrior, love gives these men strength to defend their home. Perhaps the King can do more to love these men, as they have loved him.	true

dilemmas_localised_title_shield_faithful_repentent_choice	Repentant	true
dilemmas_localised_description_shield_faithful_repentent_choice	You had a dream last night of stumbling through a dark and dreary world -- the darkness is the sorrow that you bring to others, the burden on your shoulders is the weight of your misdeeds in this life. Ghosts of men point at you accusingly as you pass them by, eagerly waiting for the day that you will join them in their misery. The Christian priests claim that all can be forgiven of their sins through the power of the Holy Saints. Perhaps it's time we pay them a visit...	true

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_faithful_friend_of_the_church_choice	There have been some grumblings in your Kingdom of late concerning the administering of the Holy Communion under both kinds (consecrated bread and wine) in the church. According to tradition, the clergy have been the only ones who would receive the consecrated wine. There are certain upstarts, however, who claim that Christ passed the cup to fisherman as an example that all were equal under God, and that all should have a chance to drink the holy wine. This dispute has the potential to tear your Kingdom apart and must be resolved.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_faithful_legendary_saint_choice	No earthly pleasures, no kingdoms of this world can benefit me in any way. I prefer death in Christ to power over the farthest limits of the earth. He who died in place of us is the one object of my quest. He who atoned for our sins is my one desire. In this I cannot please both God and the world at the same time. They are utterly opposed to each other in their thoughts, their desires, and their actions.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_brute_violent_choice	With the remains of the town still smoldering around you, your men bring you a young man with his eyes set in angry defiance. Apparently this is the son of the late Earl and was hiding in a cellar as you were sacking the town. His family may pay a handsome price for his safe return... on the other hand, the son of your enemy will grow up. And when he's grown, he'll remember the man who killed his father and come for revenge. 	true

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_brute_legendary_brute_choice	On a chilly morning, your guards bring your treacherous subject to your hall, kicking and screaming. The man has been spreading lies and other poisonous rumours about you behind your back. Even now, he curses your name and spits on your feet. He will not beg nor will he stand to be indebted to you. An example must be made of him so that your subjects will know what happens when they seek to overthrow their King. It's an unfortunate business... we can do it quick, or we can have some fun.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_tyrant_oppressor_choice	The recent peasant uprisings are a direct challenge to your authority.

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_tyrant_legendary_tyrant_choice	What shall I do with subjects who are so openly hostile to their King and determined to upset the safety of our lands? If the crew of a ship seeks to burn their own vessel and sink her, is it not incumbent on the captain to sacrifice everything needful to ensure they don't sink? When the fox is at the door, shall the chicks scorn their mother who has only sought their protection and throw her out? No more!

dilemmas_localised_description_shield_judge_just_choice	Your advisor approaches you with troubling news about the finances of our Kingdom -- we're spending far more than our coffers can withstand.
