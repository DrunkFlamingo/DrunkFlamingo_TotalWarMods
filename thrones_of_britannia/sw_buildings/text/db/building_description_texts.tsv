building_description_texts_long_description_vik_scribes_long	Before the development of early printing presses in the late medieval period, one of a monk's duties was transcribing and archiving, a physical labour that was part of his daily regime. Those chosen to be scribes were handed an unenviable task – the process of transcribing was back-bending, eye-straining work, with extended periods spent in badly lit, claustrophobic environments. Some monasteries had dedicated writing rooms attached to libraries, known as 'scriptoriums', but not all had such specialised areas. In fact, monks frequently had to find secluded spaces to do their writing wherever they could, such as their own rooms or small areas around the monastery cloister. Much of the scribe's work was religious, writing down passages from the Bible or the Psalms, which would then be recited often as part of daily life, giving the monks a closer understanding of both the text and the tenets of their religion as they worked.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_bullaun_long	A curious feature of monastic sites from Ireland’s era of Christianisation are ‘bowl’ or ‘bullaun’ stones. These artificially hollowed-out basins in rocks, boulders and slabs were used as far back as Neolithic times, but their importance to pre-Christian Irish peoples was sufficient for the early Celtic Church to want to assimilate them. These man-made fossils likely had practical uses for ancient peoples, with archaeological excavations at one site in southeastern Ireland revealing that there may have been an ironworking industry there. The bringing of bowl stones to early Celtic Christian sites strongly implies they also had spiritual or devotional functions pre-Christianity, with records located at pilgrimage sites indicating they were used in rituals. Additionally, Celtic Christian tradition records that those who drank from the stones were healed.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_textiles_long	Weaving is one of the oldest attested crafts in the world and, by antiquity, had permeated every level of society. In its most basic form, slaves and children manufactured cheap, functional cloth, but at the highest level it was practiced by noblewomen who produced rich tapestries and fabrics as a conspicuous display of wealth. In tenth-century Anglo-Saxon England, spinning, weaving, and sewing were almost exclusively female activities, attested to by the presence of a variety of cloth-making equipment in women’s graves dating back to the period. Textile production was always an important factor in most communities of the era, with plenty of evidence showing that Viking-age York was also producing large amounts of wool and flax textiles, although it is not clear whether surpluses were created for export. Findings of silk offcuts and headscarves, however, suggest that at least some textile workers were also handling exported material there.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_craft_merchant_long	Artisanship in the 9th century of England afforded people a certain standard of living in society yet it was still difficult to attain a very high social status. Artisans were classed above peasants and serfs in the feudal system and had a much better level of education. Trades were often kept within families and skills passed down from father to son. Some artisans would make things that were needed in the local economy such as a stonemason who fashioned building materials and tailors who made clothes. Every important medieval town had a blacksmith who made weaponry and a wide range of goods that had practical use in towns and villages. Surnames would often identify the trade of the artisan- names like Miller, Smith, Hunter, or Tanner.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_orchard_long	The historian Tacitus recalled that grape growing was present in Britain as far north as the Midlands prior to the Saxon arrival, despite the overly-moist soil and atmosphere in most parts of the Isles. In fact, many indigenously-grown fruits have ever been consumed all over Britain, with excavations dating back to the early Middle Ages pointing to the consumption of apples, plums, cherries, and sloes in abundance. Vineyards were recorded in the manuscript records of the Domesday book, with various royal estates in present-day Wiltshire, Worcestershire, Hampshire, and Somerset known to have been deliberately built upon orchards to take advantage of the literal fruits of the land. Various fruit-based wines were also being concocted, with evidence in Gloucester dating back to the period pointing to the presence of a large deposit of apple pips, likely to have been the result of large-scale cider production.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_alehouse_long	Thanks to the Romans, the great British pub actually started out two thousand years ago as a great Italian wine bar! Roman taverns, or ‘tabernae’, were originally set up as shops that sold wine, with a deliberate proximity to Roman roads so that many a legionary could be provided with a place to sit and quench his thirst. With ale being Britain’s native brew at the time, taverns quickly adapted to provide locals with whichever tipple they wanted, assuming it was available and the price could be paid. Through times of invasion from Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and others, alehouses and taverns thrived in Britain, eventually evolving into places that also provided food and accommodation for weary travellers such as merchants, court officials, or pilgrims. Being places of congregation in a non-religious sense, taverns also served military purposes, acting as recruitment centres for royal armies, and even for less savoury groups such as mercenaries or bandits.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_hunting_long	The concept of "The Hunt" predates recorded history; earlier human ancestors relied on hunting to survive, making it a cornerstone of the species. Despite the advent of agriculture, hunting remained important as a source of sustenance, recreation, and industry, with hides fetching as high a price as animal meat did. Hunting was carried out all across society in the early medieval British Isles, but for the elite in particular, it was an important physical pursuit. Stag-hunting, fox-hunting, and hawking were favourite pastimes of kings and nobles, and the Vikings settlers would have had a similar propensity for such outdoor activities. Excavations of sites dating back to the Dark Ages reveal sizeable amounts of antler bones, and aside from deer, hunters would have also killed hare and wild boar. Wild birds, including swans, mallards, geese, and pigeons, also provided sources of meat, with large bone deposits suggesting that birds were a significant food source for many.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_pottery_long	Clay has always been abundant in the British Isles, and before the traditional wheel-throwing techniques of pottery shaping were introduced at the end of the Iron Age, they were painstakingly shaped by hand. From the 8th century, however, pottery in Britain began to be mass-produced at industrial centres using better techniques and large purpose-built kilns. The most important centre of pottery manufacture in the era was Ipswich, which at the time transported such products to all corners of Britain. East Anglian pottery finds were commonly associated with high-status sites, indicating how highly they were valued. The presence of the Vikings, especially in urban centres like York, also appears to have affected the quality and quantity of pottery items in some places where more standardised, wheel-thrown and kiln-fired pottery was seen, mass-produced for trade using influences brought in from continental Europe.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_merchant_long	As their society developed in step with sustained periods of relative peace, the Britons, Saxons and Vikings living in the British Isles gradually moved away from basic subsistence bartering to a much more sophisticated trade model. Regular markets, permanently based around local fortresses close to rivers for ease of transport, sprung up all across the country, enabled producers to trade their surplus supplies for things they were unable to produce themselves. This gradually gave rise to a burgeoning class of merchants. Without a reliable, consistently-maintained road system, the riverways were the natural way to transport their goods, as they removed the need for trains of pack-horses and made attacks by brigands far less likely.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_fishing_long	Living in a land of long coastlines and winding rivers, the communities of the British Isles always had fish as a staple food resource. Evidence for the industrial-scale exploitation of fish dates back to the sixth century, but history tells us that some groups were still lagging behind until sometime after that. This was the case for the South Saxons of Sussex, who the historian Bede mentions were on the brink of famine in the seventh century until Bishop Wilfred taught them how to fish while on his conversion mission. Fishing methods changed relatively little throughout the Dark Ages, but were impacted by techniques brought to the Isles by outside settlers such as the Vikings. For example, the large volumes of sea fish being caught by the end of the Anglo-Saxon period were a direct result of the drift net – an imported Viking method which enabled a much greater catch out at sea.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_mountain_hall_long	Din Eidyn, the early medieval name for modern-day Edinburgh, had long been a location of significance to the numerous groups vying for power in the lands of the southern Scottish Lowlands known as the Old North. It was an area mostly inhabited by people of Celtic descent, remaining culturally and linguistically British even after the arrival of foreign groups. One of the rulers whose seat of power was located in Eidyn was Mynyddog Mwynfawr, king of the people who inhabited the Old North during the latter part of the 6th century. His name roughly translates to ‘Wealthy Mountain’, and he was alluded to as a great king who oversaw the resistance struggles of his people against the hostile expansionist kingdoms to the south. According to ancient Brythonic poetry, it was from his halls of power based in Eidyn that he sent a hand-picked elite retinue of three hundred mounted warriors on an ill-fated expedition southward against an Angle-controlled fort in Yorkshire. Although their excursion ended with their defeat and demise, the warriors and their king ‘of the mountain’ were immortalised in prose for their efforts, living on in memory through the eulogies of legendary poets.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_pasture_long	People living on the British Isles during the Anglo-Saxon period relied heavily on cattle, sheep, and pigs to provide the protein that their diets required, with bone evidence showing that pasture farming was widely practiced alongside agriculture and woodland management. Cattle offered a form of mobile wealth, especially in royal circles, as corroborated by the large number of cattle skulls dating back to the 7th century found in the palace enclosure at the historical site of Yeavering. In larger, more urban surroundings of the day such as Viking-occupied York, smaller livestock like pigs and goats were reared within tenement yards, while cattle and sheep were reared in the surrounding countryside and brought on the hoof to market. The meat of the animals wasn’t the only valuable commodity, but also the animal by-products such as wool, skins, leather, and bones for tools. Cattle dung was also highly useful, providing manure to aid agriculture in less fertile soils.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_celi_de_abbey_long	Long before the total conversion of the pagan Saxons, southern Britannia had seen the gradual spread of Christianity from the pockets of followers left by the Romans, accelerated in later centuries with Augustine’s Gregorian mission. In Ireland and parts of the north, however, a very different picture was emerging in the form of Celtic Christianity. In the two hundred years after the Romans had departed, a significant gulf had formed between the Celtic and Roman missions, which saw Celtic monotheistic spirituality develop freely in isolation from Rome’s dominion. By the end of the sixth century, Celtic Christianity was wholly monastic in its structure, spearheaded by ascetic communities in Ireland whose efforts saw the large-scale conversion away from paganism on the island. Several aspects of the Celts’ tribal outlook were reflected in their newly-emerging religious practices, with an understanding of faith that celebrated grace and nature as gifts from God, with strong traditions of poetry, mysticism, and inclusion of women in its leadership.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_granary_long	Archaeological evidence indicates that the main catalyst for the human transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer was the cultivation of wheat and grain. A useful food source both directly and as an animal feed, grain was highly important to sedentary societies for thousands of years, dating back to Neolithic times. Its obvious advantage was the ability to harvest a surplus, which gave rise to the need for granaries. In Britain, the Roman villa system meant that a vast amount of farming was taking place before the era of Saxon dominance, and subsequent settlers on the Isles continued using the old Roman techniques of grain storage. Granaries had raised floors to allow air to circulate, keeping the yield dry and mould-free, as well as protecting it against ground-based pests. The bulkiness of surpluses also meant that granary walls had to be thick enough to resist great weight, while extra-wide eaves ensured that walls also stayed absolutely dry.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_garrison_long	Not all warriors fight on the front line, at the literal bleeding edge of war. In a world before professional, large-scale armies, garrisons were used as a method of cultural conversion, and then as a defensive redoubt. The Romans called their process of garrisoning 'colonia', which involved settling citizens in conquered towns to Romanise the population. This occurred in Britain before the dominance of the Saxons, who later used a ‘fyrd’ system of mobilised armies made up of self-equipped freemen. For many groups of that era, in the most desperate times of war every able-bodied man would have been encouraged to fight, but where men could be spared a garrison would have been left behind to help protect the populace and their commodities. In the worst of times, however, when kingdoms suffered significant losses, garrisons were reserved for the most valuable of settlements. After all, kingdoms could be rebuilt, but a warrior could only die once.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_assembly_long	In the early medieval world, the governance of the populace was aided by areas where large congregations of people could be addressed directly by their leaders. As the kings of post-Roman Britain saw the number of people under their rule increase, they needed more effective ways to consolidate their power over them. Appearing before their subjects in person and speaking to them face-to-face was one such method, and the use of outdoor assembly areas made it possible in practice. The king still had to get to such places, however, travelling with his retinue to settlements with such facilities, where his subjects in the area would congregate before him. Archaeological evidence in Northumbria indicates that outdoor assemblies and grandstands were, in effect, like the parliament buildings of the early Middle Ages, where it was likely some back-and-forth would have occurred between the king and his subjects. They were probably cuneiform in shape, triangular buildings with sitting-steps focused on an area bordered by a screen at the back and sides to aid voice amplification. Since they were places of royal use, they were contained within protected hill-forts or fortified parts of settlements.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_library_long	Even prior to King Alfred’s education reforms that he was so well-known for, historical records point to an earlier era of scholarship in England and Ireland coinciding with the region’s conversion to Christianity. In the time of Bede, the ‘Father of English History’, the libraries of the Dark Ages were exclusively places of ecclesiastical learning, used and run by monks in monasteries. Bede himself was an author, scholar, and priest, whose works imply that he had access to a great many books of contemporary and classical authors of his day. Indeed, it is known that Bede’s very own monastery had an impressive library of imported works. Most of the books found there would have been written in Latin, and his work alludes to a familiarity with Christian poets, classical historians and authors, Latin grammarians, and even some works in Greek, probably of theological origin.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_workshop_long	As Britannia settled into a period of uneasy peace following the Vikings’ settlement of the Danelaw during the 9th century, the work of British craftsmen began to gain popularity both abroad and at home. As a result of increases in demand, particularly from Church building projects which required highly-skilled, ornate workmanship delivered to tight deadlines, small ‘cottage’ industries gave way to workshops where production could be better organised to meet the cost and time constraints of the project in hand.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_artisans_long	Jewellery was always very important to the Anglo-Saxons, with fine objects being crafted from precious metals such as gold, amethyst and even amber depending on the social status of the wearer. Due to the diverse nature of Isles’ population, it’s unsurprising that much of the jewellery produced around the time of the 7th and 8th centuries, particularly in Saxon and Viking England, had central and northern European influences at first. Over time, however, a unique, insular style developed here which fed back into central and southern Europe, with the work of Saxon jewellers adorning churches as far south as Rome itself. As a result of this demand, goldsmiths in particular were allowed to move freely wherever their work took them.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_copper_long	Copper is the oldest known metal in the world, the use of which dates back many centuries BC. It was known to the Greeks and Romans as 'cuprum' or 'cyprium', a reference to Cyprus, one of the largest copper mines in the ancient world. It is the primary ingredient of bronze, and although the bronze age ended in roughly 1200 BC to give way to the widespread use of iron, the good rust resistance of copper alloys guaranteed the continued use of bronze in a variety of outdoor applications. It was used for things like door components, fountains, statues, horse-related apparatus, buckles, and anything else that might be exposed to moisture. Copper was also collected, traded, and used by the Vikings, especially for jewellery, with places like 9th century Viking-occupied York known to have been a location of the manufacture of many such trinkets for trade purposes.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_silver_long	By the end of the 8th century, most silver used to mint coins on the British Isles was thought to have originated overseas. Local veins had been worked out from Roman times, and mining technology was beyond the experience and investment potential of the time. Eventually, however, Britain and Ireland’s small-scale silver mining industries grew to cater for the increased use of coin in commercial transactions. Shallow enriched ore deposits in Carboniferous Limestone areas were put into use, although deeper-seated deposits of higher yields would not be exploited until several centuries later. In the invading Vikings’ hands, silver was donned in various forms as high-status dress items or broken up as a form of hack-silver currency. Hoard findings dating back to the ninth century also indicate that most plundered Viking silver was likely kept until eventually melted down into more acceptable forms more useful to their bullion economy, such as ingots and rings.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_estate_long	With the collapse the Roman Empire, Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. In Britain, many kings of the land used a system in which they would garner favour from their nobles and their retinues by bequeathing their estates scattered throughout their realm. Estates were highly profitable for a noble or ealdorman, largely used to provide coin for things like payments to armies, or the hiring of labour to build fortifications and bridges in the surrounding area. Estate manors were also used as royal accommodation, as kings commonly moved from one estate to another when travelling and conducting royal business. It was no small matter to offer hospitality to royal company, and it was not uncommon for purveyors to inspect a royal estate for its provisions and amenities the day before a royal visit, if not only to ensure an adequate supply of mead!	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_market_long	By the time of Viking settlement on the British Isles, the locals were already trading in at least two important commodities on a large scale – salt and metals. The former was crucial for meat and fish preservation, while the latter was needed to make the tools and weapons with which livelihoods were made and protected respectively. In agricultural trade, most large-scale farmers produced yields of crops to fulfil an obligation to a lord or king on top of their own subsistence, but any surplus would then be sold at a grain exchange or fair. The Viking threat to the Isles also provided a motor for trade there, with centres of commerce blossoming where people had gathered to live more safely in greater numbers. In fact, several 9th century market towns prospered due to their proximity with King Alfred the Great’s 'burhs', a system of forts originally established as a network of Saxon strongholds to defend against invasion.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_court_long	Although Welsh law became increasingly superseded by English law in the 13th century, Wales had a rich legal tradition dating back to a few hundred years before that. The 10th century Welsh monarch Howel Dda, also known as 'Howel the Good', was chiefly remembered for consolidating all the laws used to govern Welsh lands, which gradually fell into his dominion through his marital ties and deaths in his ruling family. He did not create the laws as such – many actually predated his lifetime – but he was believed to have adapted existing law traditions to codify into his own legal tenets, which came to be known as the 'Law of Howel'. It is thought that his epithet 'the Good' was due to the fact that his laws did not overly stress his royal power, but instead were aimed at protecting the people of Wales. Living under Howel’s laws became one of the definitions of Welsh people in the centuries to come, with the Welsh lawbooks and legal manuscripts of the era giving a fascinating insight into life in early medieval Wales.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tanner_long	People have used hides to protect and clothe themselves ever since they began to trap and kill animals. As animal husbandry developed and the availability of hides increased, tanning processes were introduced to make leathers more durable. By the Middle Ages, tanning was becoming an important trade, with archaeological evidence of Saxon-era tanneries seen in places like Winchester, where two rectangular pits were found at Lower Brook Street. The pits were lined with clay and wood, with a water channel running through the room which was wide enough to wash hides, and traces of animal hairs found around the pits assumed to be sweepings from the surrounding area. Most tellingly, these elements were all located in a house which fronted onto a road known as Tannerestret, the 'Street of the Tanners’, a name dating from the late 10th century. Today, there is a Tanner Street in many English towns and cities.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_konungsgurtha_long	Following the Vikings’ prolonged campaigns against the Saxons, part of the invading Great Army returned to Northumbria in AD 876 and the newly-conquered lands were shared out amongst them. York had already seen several battles and sieges by that time, with many parts of the city damaged from the struggles. Buildings such as the old Roman defences and towers had deteriorated into a poor condition, and those which were damaged but hadn't yet fallen were demolished by the new settlers. In addition to cultivating the surrounding land with the intention to stay permanently, history also relates how the Vikings rebuilt parts of the city. The southwest gate of the original fortress had survived, so was used to form part of a new royal palace of the Viking kings, a building that became known as the ‘Konungsgurtha’, or the ‘King’s Court’ in Old Norse. It acted as the seat of the subsequent Viking rulers of Northumbria in the following years and nucleated the city, with new streets and timber houses added to the surrounding area over time.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_grianan_ailech_long	One of the most magnificent remnants of the Irish-Gaelic kingdoms of old is the 1500 year-old circular hillfort known as Grianan of Aileach. Still standing on Greenan Mountain today, the monument was once a bastion of the Kingdom of Aileach, which flourished between the 5th and 12th centuries. However, the location’s importance stretches back several thousands of years before that. A prehistoric burial mound is evidence of human activity as far back as Neolithic times. The great stone ringfort there today has been restored from the one built by the ruling Ui Neill dynasty in the 6th century, but an older hillfort was one of just five Irish sites on Ptolemy of Alexandria’s 2nd century map of the world, indicating that the site was in similar use far earlier.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_thing_long	Wherever the Vikings arrived to settle, they brought their customs and legal systems with them, as it was during their settlement in Britain. In the latter part of the 9th century, the area in which the laws of the recently settled Danes held sway was known as the Danelaw – a geographical demarcation created after King Alfred of the West Saxons inflicted defeat upon them in AD 878, resulting in a treaty that granted them the lands of the ‘Five Boroughs’ in which to expound their own laws. It was in these regions that the freemen of Viking society would gather into ‘Things’ to settle their disputes out in the open. Things were groups of individuals assembled to make collective decisions, a practice considered to be the cradle of Scandinavian democracy. They would make important political decisions, while overseeing that laws were being upheld, and the ‘Thingsteads’ where they would gather were often the focal points for trade and religious activity. In Viking-age Britain, the use of Things was not confined to the Danelaw, but everywhere the Vikings settled, including Shetland, Orkney, the highlands of Scotland, and Man.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_fogou_long	Some of the oldest and most interesting examples of human habitation in ancient Cornwall are several ancient, man-made caves and passageways known as ‘fogous’, named for the Cornish word ‘fogo’, meaning ‘cave’. Although similar to souterrains and earth-houses found in Scotland and Ireland, the Cornish examples differ in that they were often found in more settled areas protected by earthwork defences and inhabited by several families. Fogous continued to be important into the Viking era and their proximity to settlements indicates they were probably places of refuge and storage, with constricting ‘creep’ entrances providing some level of hindrance to attackers. Another curious feature hints at ritualistic use, as their passageways were almost always orientated towards the rising and setting midsummer sun.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_dewi_long	Sometime in the early 6th century, as a wild thunderstorm battered the cliffs of modern-day Pembrokeshire in southwest Wales, Saint David was born. A man of considerable importance to the Celtic Church in his later life, he was originally named ‘Dewidd’, locally pronounced as ‘Dewi’. Accounts compiled many centuries after his lifetime allude to him being the son of a Welsh prince, with some legends claiming that his birth was foretold to Saint Patrick by an angel thirty years before it occurred. David was a puritan who practiced strict self-imposed penance, only consuming bread, vegetables, and water, and his most well-known miracle was the conjuring up of a hill beneath his own feet as he delivered a sermon to a large crowd, elevating himself so he could be seen and heard by all. David’s assignation as the patron saint of Wales is certainly attributed to many such legends and miracles, as well as tangible facts. Historically, he is thought to have founded many monasteries, including one in Menevia, near to his birthplace. The settlement which grew around it became known as ‘Tyddewi’, or ‘David’s House’, which later encompassed a site of great pilgrimage when it housed the great saint’s relics within the Cathedral of St David.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_cloth_long	Much of Britain is ideal for raising sheep, though the growing importance of cavalry for economic and military reasons led many kings to devote more effort towards the rearing of horses. 	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tools_long	Without the invention, innovation, and manufacture of tools, civilisation would not experience progress. Tools facilitate the necessities of survival, and where one tool is unsuitable, efforts are generally made to invent new ones. In many cases, such processes are organic and come about naturally by osmosis from other cultures. For example, there is no firm evidence for the use of an ox or horse-drawn plough by the Anglo-Saxons prior to the 10th century, but it is thought that before that time, land cultivation was carried out with the use of wooden harrows, such as the one depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry. Unsurprisingly, tool development has always been intrinsically linked to advancements in materials and metallurgy. With the Iron Age already well underway in Europe by the time the Romans withdrew from Britain, the use of iron tools was already fairly widespread by the time the Vikings arrived.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_thrall_long	The post-Roman era slave trade was reasonably active on the British Isles by the time of the Viking raids - a remnant of the socio-political systems left behind by the Romans themselves. Although the Romans never annexed Ireland specifically into their empire, they still had a commercial relationship with the island, creating a slave trade which even caused a depopulation there at the time. When the Viking kings settled, they brought with them their three-tiered stratification of society – noblemen, freemen, and thralls – which served to give the slave trade an even greater importance locally. Irish kings of the 10th century were also known to take swathes of slaves as booties of war, undoubtedly to profit from the burgeoning local slave markets of Ireland’s major ports at the time, which had been spearheaded by Viking settlement.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_arena_long	Fighting as entertainment has deep roots which stretch back to antiquity. Homer mentions boxing in his epic 'the Iliad' in the eighth century BC, and an early version of mixed martial arts combining fist-fighting and wrestling known as 'pankration' was a common sight at the early Olympic Games. More broadly, fist-fighting was a common way of settling disputes throughout history, especially in societies in which warfare was part of life such as Viking-era Britain. The works of the historian Bede mention wild, physical, and competitive games that were encouraged to develop the warrior elite of English society, and one might assume that one-on-one combat was amongst such activities. Although it may have ended in injury or death for one of the participants, fighting as a spectacle would have been considered much more valuable and honourable for the participant – and arguably more entertaining for the spectator – than other pastimes of the era such as bear-baiting and cock-fighting.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_church_crafts_long	Although a love of jewellery and crafts was already ingrained with British and Anglo-Saxon culture by the time of their conversion to Christianity, the Church nevertheless became a driving force for many of the crafts produced from that point onwards. Aside from metal and glass work, advanced textiles and tapestry-work became part of a signature style and votive pieces. In fact, on the continent ‘Opus Anglicanum’ (literally ‘English Work’) was considered to be among the finest of its kind produced at the time, and was used to decorate European churches from the 8th century until the Norman conquest of 1066.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_forge_long	The honest work of the blacksmith enabled land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with more terrible savagery than ever before. During the Anglo-Saxon era, forges were commonly ephemeral in nature, often roofless to allow as much light in as possible to judge the state of work and surrounded by wattle wind-breaks rather than solid walls – nothing too costly to lose if loose sparks caused a fire. There was usually not much more than a hearth containing a heat source in addition to an anvil upon which the actual hammering took place, sometimes in the form of solid block of cast iron, especially in instances of large-scale production. Tongs, hammers, and bellows have also all been found in areas identified as forge sites of the early Middle Ages, all of which would have been absolutely essential to make a smithy’s painstaking job much easier.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_church_long	By the time the Vikings had settled down in Britain, Christianity had already gained a considerable foothold there. Having been brought to the Isles centuries earlier as one of many Roman cults, Christianity did not only outlive the Roman occupation, but survived in the face of the numerous forms of paganism brought by successive invaders such as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and others. In the post-Roman period, the decaying stone remains left by the occupiers inspired settlers with superstitious awe, and provided Christian moralists with a fruitful theme to disseminate their beliefs amongst the population. Spurred on by the missions of Saint Augustine of Canterbury to convert the settled Germanic tribes, several churches were embedded within old Roman edifices throughout England, while in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, small monastic communities had already become the focal points of most villages. Such locations provided the nuclei for towns and cities which still exist to this day.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_port_trade_long	References to the first merchant ships in Britain date back to before the Viking invasions, with the occupying Romans of earlier centuries also being a large part of the maritime trade that was occurring in late antiquity. The works of the 5th century historian Orosius mention the Saxon word ‘ceapscip’, a direct translation of ‘trading ship’, the examples of which by that time had developed features that were distinctly non-military in function. For example, many had a broad high-sided hull to maximise cargo space, or a reliance on a sail as a primary means of propulsion, since sailing ships had less oarsmen aboard to facilitate more space for cargo. The Viking raids in Britain also resulted in several market ports prospering out of Alfred’s systematic 'burh' fortifications. Trading ports like Hastings and Southampton especially benefited, thriving from the presence of a local populace who sought the protection of the royally decreed forts in coastal areas.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_columbe_long	The cathedral which stands in Dunkeld, Scotland today is dedicated to Saint Columbe, one of the famed ‘Twelve Apostles of Ireland’ responsible for the spreading of early Christianity in the region. Its location has long been considered holy ground to Scottish Christianity, ever since Celtic missionaries built the first monastery there in the eighth century within the settlement previously known as ‘Dun Cailden’. It eventually became a major religious centre and place of pilgrimage, especially after Saint Columbe’s relics were moved there from the island of Iona in the face of increasing Viking raids in around AD 850. Columbe himself was, in fact, a descendant of Irish kings, but had become a luminary amongst the Scottish saints after his mission to convert the Gaels and Picts of Scotland in the 6th century. The monastery he set up in Iona became a place of great religious renown and spiritual authority, where several kings, both Gaelic and Viking, sought to be buried due to it being the resting place of Columbe himself, until his relics were moved to Dun Cailden in the 9th century.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_cuthbert_long	There are conflicting accounts about the early life of Saint Cuthbert, whose later gift for miraculous healing in an era of frequent sickness had earned him the label ‘Wonder-worker of England’. Flourishing during the 7th century, some historical sources claim he was the son of an Irish king, while others say he was born into poverty in Scotland and fought as young warrior in service to the Kingdom of Northumbria. In any case, Cuthbert became one of the most important figures of the Saxon church in his later life, taking up the priorship of Lindisfarne from AD 664 after Northumbria’s controversial decision to follow Rome’s Christianity in lieu of the already well-established Celtic tradition. Although renowned for being an outgoing, cheerful, and compassionate missionary, he spent his final years as a hermit, and by the time of his death had become so revered that his final resting place at Lindisfarne became a location of mass pilgrimage. Centuries later, the Viking invasions prompted the Lindisfarne monks to evacuate Saint Cuthbert’s remains from the island, and after seven years the relics eventually found their way to nearby Dunholm – modern-day Durham – where a church was built to house them, ironically benefacted by a converted Danish king.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_school_ros_long	In its beginnings as an early Christian settlement, the ancient Irish town of Rosscarbery in modern-day County Cork may have seemed comparatively unimportant, but it eventually became one of the most celebrated locations of religious learning in the Dark Ages. The Irish monk and eventual saint known as Fachtna came to the area towards the end of the 6th century and founded a monastery there, later the principal monastery in southwest Cork and the centre from which the Diocese of Ross developed. Most notably, Fachtna’s establishment came to include the famous scripture school known as the School of Ross, renowned at the time as one of the great seats of Christian education and sanctity. Such was the number of students and monks travelling to it from far and wide to study under the most eminent ecclesiastical professors, that the early form of the settlement’s name, ‘Ros’, meaning ‘wooded headland’ in Old Irish, became ‘Ros-Ailithir’, translating to ‘wooded headland of the pilgrims’. The settlement’s location on seaward slopes at the edge of sheltered cliffs was likely a deliberately defensible position, where the monks could watch for invaders, although the Vikings would not show up for at least another 150 years.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_high_cross_long	In the centuries following the missions of the monk Saint Fursey to convert the British Isles to Christianity, his homeland of Ireland saw the appearance of an art form considered to be their biggest contribution to western European art of the Middle Ages – the Celtic high cross. These free-standing structures mimicked the smaller crosses made out wood and metal common in the period with larger stone versions commonly placed in the grounds of monasteries and cemeteries, as well as sometimes being the focal point for town markets. They were generally used as meeting points for religious ceremonies, but were also placed at crossroads and used to mark out land boundaries. In Ireland, the earliest and most famous examples date back to the 8th or 9th century, and are situated within a few miles of each other in the southwest of the island. The Killamery High Cross located in County Kilkenny is one such example – not only because it is very richly sculptured in images and iconography which are decipherable even today – but also because it was built in a monastery established by a direct disciple of Saint Fursey himself, Saint Goban.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_warehouse_long	As Britannia’s late-Dark Ages arts and crafts culture advanced, systems of trade developed naturally in tandem with it. Merchants operated by purchasing more goods than they needed and then selling on the surplus for a profit, then – if they were shrewd – investing some of that profit back into their businesses. The nature of the free market means demand frequently outstrips supply and vice-versa. This means the serious merchant had to have somewhere to store goods safely, both from the elements and those who would take it from them – thus, warehouses as we know them were born. Generally, these storage spaces would be next the rivers or ports in order to transport the goods around inland or abroad as needed.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_embroiders_long	Spinning and weaving was a craft that earned Canterbury industrial prosperity at various points in its past, and history tells us that an older tradition of embroidery actually existed there as far back as the Dark Ages. A building that still stands in the city today known as ‘The Old Weavers’ House’ was where the Canterbury weavers of the sixteenth century gained their fame, but part of the structure is believed to date back to around the Anglo-Saxon era when the town was known as 'Cantwaraburg', and was a likely location for the production of Opus Anglicanum, or ‘English Work’. This medieval custom of decadent embroidery made use of gold thread, carried out by highly-skilled professionals who would take up to seven years to perfect their craft. The resulting work was unequalled in craftsmanship anywhere else in Europe at the time, resulting in much sought-after fabrics commonly donned as ceremonial clothing by royalty or the clergy, but also used for decorative purposes like the famous example of the Bayeux Embroidery. Another existing specimen is the gold and silk embroidery which drapes the reliquary coffin containing the relics of Saint Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral, identified as being West Saxon Opus Anglicanum work of the tenth century.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_ciaran_long	Saint Ciaran was one of the esteemed ‘Twelve Apostles of Ireland’, famously founding a great monastery at Cluain Mac Nois in County Offaly in the 6th century. It became the most influential religious facility of its time, notable for being where the 'Rule of St Ciaran' was developed, the set of ascetic tenets followed by most monastic institutions of the era. The monastery’s geographical location – right in the centre of Ireland positioned next to a river – was due to a premonition had by Ciaran and the famous monk Enda while he was studying under him on the island of Inishmore off the western coast of the mainland. Both men had the same vision of a fruit-laden tree growing on the banks of a stream in the middle of Ireland, with branches spreading out over the entirety of the land. They also saw birds carrying the tree’s fruits off to Britain and elsewhere, all of which Enda interpreted as his student's calling to travel to the centre of Ireland to found a church to spread their beliefs. This was how Ciaran came to establish his famous abbey at Cluain Mac Nois, which became a famous monastic town of the early Middle Ages.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_ringan_long	Known to the Northumbrians as ‘Trynnian’ or 'Ninian', Ringan of Whithorn was once considered one of the most important religious figures in Britain. Mentioned fleetingly by the great Northumbrian historian Bede, Saint Ringan was an important part of the Christianisation of the Picts during the 4th and 5th centuries. His greatest achievement, however, was the establishment of his monastery in Galloway. As Pictish Christian centres gradually came under Northumbrian Church control, Ringan’s monastery became a leading monastic centre for northern Anglo-Saxons. There are even several churches and chapels dedicated to him today, particularly in places of Pictish heritage or within old Northumbrian bounds.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_brigit_long	Saint Brigit of Nas is one of the best-known Irish saints after Patrick, and like him, much of what is known of her has been encapsulated in the folklore of the region. Her name is analogous with a Celtic goddess associated with many fables and myths of the era in which she lived, which added to her legend. After a childhood spent as a slave, she became known for unceasingly feeding and healing the poor and was famed for her extraordinary purity, piety, and generosity. Such was her reputation that in the late-5th century, the king of Leinster donated a plane of land to her in Nas, modern-day Kildare. On the site stood a large oak tree, under which Saint Brigit built her church known as the ‘Church of the Oak’, or ‘Cill Dara’ in Old Gaelic, after which county Kildare is named. It is widely considered to have been the first nunnery in Ireland, with many other communities of nuns founded by Brigit during her time. Many accounts describe her as a generous woman who performed miracles, and she is even sometimes considered to be a patron saint of beer, allegedly having the ability to turn dirty bathwater into the alcoholic beverage!	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_souterrain_long	The use of underground storage is something that the archaeological record shows was common in Ireland and northern Britain, with many examples of souterrains and ‘earth-houses’ distributed throughout Scotland dating back to Roman times. The meaning of souterrain is literally ‘underground’, and such places took the form of passageways, dwellings, and storage facilities hidden just beneath the surface. Their most likely function was food storage, as in Scotland they appear to have been a northern counterpart to the pits and silos of England used for grain surpluses in early medieval times. The evidence for this is a broad correlation between the locations of known souterrains from the period, and the areas known to have good quality arable land at the time. Such cool underground spaces would have also been suitable for milk or meat, while even livestock could have taken refuge in them, although this would have only happened in the largest facilities.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_swithun_long	Swithun was one of the most famous bishops of Winchester in the early medieval period, remembered for having great importance to his diocese during and after his 9th century lifetime. An immensely charitable soul who founded many churches, he was also an active counsellor to Saxon kings and even allegedly tutored the young Alfred the Great himself, helping to pave the future king’s way to his later accolades. Swithun had his holy reputation significantly boosted posthumously, after his remains were dug up from their original burial location outside Old Minster and placed within a splendid reliquary inside the building many years later, thus providing a new patron saint and focus of reverence for a newly-formed community of Benedictine monks. Saint Swithun's relics had been associated with several miraculous healing events by that time, but their exhumation and relocation went against his explicit wishes for his grave to be humbly placed outside where ‘the feet of ordinary men could pass over him’ and raindrops could fall upon it. In fact, legend has it that their removal from their original location was accompanied by forty days and forty nights of violent rain storms, a sign of the great saint’s displeasure at being displaced.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_sculptors_long	It has been suggested that Roman sculptured remains in the north of England may have formed the inspiration for a school of sculptors in the region, who produced works of outstanding merit during and after the Viking settlement of Britain. Rich evidence of historical sculpturing traditions exists in southern Scotland, Cumbria, and Yorkshire, with Glasgow in particular being home to the famous stones of one of its former burghs, Govan. Known as the ‘hogbacks’, they are an impressive collection of 10th century sandstone blocks unique to northern Britain, carved in elaborate symbols and decoration. They were imposing monuments distinctively Norse in style, thought to have been made to make the tombs of the dead look like mighty buildings. At the time of their creation, no other part of Europe was known to be producing sculpture of comparable quality. The Viking influence is indicative of their cultural influence in the region, and in fact, Govan’s rise to prominence as the centre of power for the local chieftains was a direct result of the Norse sacking of Dumbarton in AD 870. Above all, the Govan stones are indicative of the strong connection that kingdoms like Strathclyde and other northern lands had with the Scandinavian world.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_edmund_long	Edmund was king of East Anglia when the Danish army rampaged across it in AD 870, and eventually met his end at their hands. He was not the first or the last king to be killed by a Viking army, but it was a sensationalised version of his death that resulted in a cult forming around him which endured well into the medieval period. As the story goes, King Edmund was initially captured and offered the chance to surrender, but adamantly insisted that he would only do so on the condition that the Danish leader Ivar the Boneless be baptised. Other accounts say that he also refused to renounce his faith when challenged to do so, nor would he accept that his kingdom become a vassal to the Danish heathen overlords. In any case, the enraged Vikings tied him to a tree for his insolence, filled him with arrows, and beheaded him. Edmund’s martyrdom quickly made him a beacon of resistance for Christians under Danish heathen subjection, as shown by the coins etched with his image appearing within decades of his death. Interestingly, once the Danes converted and became widely settled in the region, they too venerated the shrine of Saint Edmund.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_apple_ash_long	Certain records of the early Middle Ages relate that in the lands of south Wales near to the mouth of the River Wye, there once stood a mysterious grove of curiously unique fruit-bearing trees. The early ninth-century Welsh antiquary known as Nennius referred to them in his works as ‘apple-bearing ash trees’, which would have had a miraculous existence to the people of the time, since ash trees do not typically bear apple-like fruits. Interestingly, Nennius referred to the grove as ‘Metambala’, a name also seen in Roman records thought to be a corruption of the ancient Greek name ‘Nemetabala’, meaning ‘Sacred Grove of Apple Trees’. In reality, these were likely to be references to a rare cluster of Sorbus Domestica, a tree of edible fruits known to have once grown in sparse locations in Britain, but no longer. For the people of the Dark Ages, however, no other trees had more associations of an ancient, mystical, or sacred nature than ash trees, particularly ones which bore fruit. In fact, dendrologists assert that the Sorbus Domestica had never been indigenous to Britain and were probably imported by the Romans, another reason that the people of the post-Roman era may have considered them so extraordinary.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_guildhall_long	Following the agrarian backwardness of the post-Roman era, the gradual growth of towns in Britain led to the formation of guilds. In modern terms, these groups could be considered the labour unions of the time, and were broadly split into two types – merchant guilds and craftsmen guilds. Before then, merchants had mostly existed as independent peddlers travelling from town to town, carrying out their own transactions at the mercy of local taxes. At the same time, the artisans of day often operated with unregulated prices, since they were craftsmen and not businessmen, causing them to come under scrutiny from customers. Guilds protected both workers and consumers – one merchant by himself would find it difficult to challenge unfairly high taxes, whereas the guilds had much more power in that respect. For consumers, guilds ensured standardisation of business and crafting practices, meaning they would not be getting unfair deals or sub-standard quality goods. Guild members would regularly gather in a guildhall to discuss matters of their trade, and to take payment from their members. In fact, the word ‘guild’ comes from the Saxon word ‘gilden’ meaning ‘to pay’, referring to the subscription payments made by its members.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_longphort_long	Entries in the Annals of Ulster for AD 842 speak of the Vikings’ first overwintering in Ireland as a highly remarkable event, which marked the beginning of their founding of several fortified naval bases known as ‘longphorts’. The initial Viking forays into Ireland and its surrounding isles in the previous century were typically rapidly executed raids to extract plunder followed by fast getaways by sea, but over time the duration of their stays were extended as they sought to take advantage of more raiding opportunities with each trip. Unlike on the British mainland where existing structures such as old Roman forts were often commandeered as base camps, in Ireland the Vikings built coastal earthwork defences from scratch, setting up camps in defensible positions such as shorelines cut off from inland areas by rivers or other geographical features. Many of these locations were the nuclei for a string of longphorts all along the Irish coastline in the modern-day locations of Waterford, Wexford, Limerick, and most importantly, Dublin, which became the Vikings’ principal base on the island in the era of Viking settlement.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_achadh_bo_long	The history of the Irish hamlet of Aghaboe is closely tied to Saint Canice, one of the famed ‘Twelve Apostles of Ireland’ who founded an abbey there in the 6th century. ‘Cainnech’ - as he was then known - was extremely well travelled and educated, which was reflected in Aghaboe’s prominence as a major centre for learning. Although a man of the cloth, he is said to have led a Christian force against the last archdruid at Kilkenny, symbolically ending paganism in Ireland. During Cainnech’s time, both Aghaboe and Kilkenny fell under Osraige’s (an early-medieval Irish kingdom) jurisdiction, with his abbey serving as its principal church and royal burial place, also having commercial and agricultural significance, as implied by the Gaelic name ‘Achadh Bó’, meaning ‘field of the cows’.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_runestone_long	Although laconic in nature, runestones provide an invaluable snapshot into the Viking Age. Several of these stone monuments inscribed with the Scandinavian alphabet are found in the Isle of Man, a place with little written historical record of Vikings, but much physical evidence of their past presence. Apart from numerous burial mounds there that have since been proven to be of Viking origin, many examples of runestones still survive, and appear to have served a similar purpose to Celtic high crosses – memorials to the dead. Little is known about the conversion of Norse settlers to Christianity, but at some point in the 9th or 10th centuries, the Norse settlers in Man started burying their deceased in existing Christian cemeteries. It is here that an apparent amalgamation of traditions took place, with many existing runestones taking the form of standing cross slabs carved with decoration on both sides. Additionally, the faces of these monuments were carved with images such as knot-work, interlacing patterns, or ring chains, sometimes accompanied by runic writing clearly indicating their Viking origin.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_martyrs_mint_long	At the beginning of the Viking Age, few Norse peoples would have had any knowledge of coinage, apart from some foreign coins that may have entered as a result of trade. Their bullion-based economy – that is, an economy based on the weight and purity of precious metals rather than their form or symbolism – meant that in many cases coins were melted down to make jewellery or ornamental weapons, the most common symbols of status for the Vikings. Their arrival in Britain brought them into contact with the monetary economy of the Isles, with each of the main Anglo-Saxon kingdoms having their own coinage systems. With Viking settlement came the creation of their own coins, serving as interesting evidence of the amalgamation of cultures that took place. Not only is there evidence on coins which depict both Christian and Viking-pagan symbolism, but also that the settled Vikings recognised martyrs such as Saint Edmund of East Anglia, who was purportedly killed by the Danes, then later venerated by them with their transition to the Christian faith.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_patraic_long	Political turmoil between the northern Irish kingdoms of the Dark Ages led to the early rise in importance of the hill fort which stood at Ard Macha in the 4th century. The town which grew there eventually became one of the ecclesiastical capitals of the medieval world, adopted as a metropolitan diocese by Saint Patrick and the location of his principal church built some time in the 5th century. The story of the legendary saint himself before that time is one embellished with so many legends and tales that it is difficult to separate some facts from fiction. Born to a family in Britain, Patrick's teenage years spent as a slave in Ireland saw him fervently turn to his faith before his escape. As with many sainthood stories, however, the central turning point of his life was a later vision that compelled him to return to Ireland where he travelled the length and breadth of the land to baptise, convert, and confirm with indefatigable zeal. It was this famous mission that turned the island to the Christian God and inspired the founding of countless churches there, like the one he established himself in Armagh, Northern Ireland, the modern-day location of the old hill fort at Ard Macha.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_wood_long	In the early medieval period, the landscapes of the British Isles were home to great stretches of continuous forest, far more extensive than their modern remnants. Agriculture was vitally important to those who lived off the land, but significant amounts of uncultivated woodlands were often kept as carefully managed resources, and for good reason. Timber has been essential for life and trade for as long as humans have cut down trees, with domestic, military, and naval applications, and forests were also important habitats for hunted animals. Woodworking was also an important industry in places like Viking-occupied York, where a myriad of different wooden items were manufactured and traded. In fact, the ancient street in York known as Coppergate, famed for its connection to the city’s Viking past, derives its name from the old Norse words ‘koppari’ (cupmaker) and ‘gata’ (street), due to the number of woodworkers present there in the Viking era.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_bard_long	The tribal kingdoms of Wales and the Old North always maintained a separate identity from the other peoples with whom they shared the Isles. The Celtic bardic tradition, for example, was one that differed from the Anglo-Saxon one, gradually disappearing from mainland Europe from the start of the Christian era but surviving for several more centuries in Britain. As parts of Wales and the Scottish Lowlands suffered from periodic political and military upheavals throughout the Dark Ages, the shared culture of their peoples remained anchored in the stories and poems of their bards and storytellers. In fact, such was the efficacy of the Welsh bards to their culture that when King Edward I managed to end the rule of the Welsh princes in the thirteenth century, he took additional steps to ensure that their royal bardic tradition would also be abolished. In earlier history, there are a number of notable examples of Brythonic lyric-writing poets of epic verse – Taliesin, for example, who was thought to have been a native of the sixth-century kingdom of Powys, and had several poems attributed to him in works compiled several hundred years after his death which still survive today.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_gold_long	It was the Romans who first started the industrial processing of gold in Britain, having mined the Dolaucothi deposit in south Wales throughout their occupation. In the early medieval period, the growing kingdoms of the Isles had access to gold-based wealth that may have been obtained locally, since records tell us they were able to pay off successive groups of raiding Vikings with gold coin and artefacts. The exact sources of their gold is unclear, however, since there is little record of the previously Roman-controlled Welsh mines being exploited in the Dark Ages, but some of it was likely obtained in other deposits that existed in Cornwall, Devon, and more further afield in Ireland. More direct evidence of local reserves only emerges in the late medieval period, when the right to work gold-bearing deposits was regularly recited in decrees made by the English Crown from the early fourteenth century onwards.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_lead_long	Stained-glass windows have been admired for their utility and beauty since ancient Rome, and it was in Europe where the art of stained glass reached its height when magnificent windows were created for great cathedrals. The basic ingredients for making glass are sand and wood ash (potash). The mixture is melted into liquid which, when cooled, becomes glass. To color the glass, certain powdered metals are added to the mixture while the glass is still molten. Molten glass can be blown into a sausage shape, then slit on the side before being flattened into a sheet; it can also be spun with a pontil iron into a round sheet (crown). A window’s pictorial image is created by arranging the different pieces of colored glass over the design drawn on a piece of board. If fine details such as shadows or outlines are required, the artist paints them on the glass with black paint. Over the years, different techniques were developed which helped progress the production of stained glass windows. For example, early Gothic stained glass windows were divided by heavy metal frames, whilst later examples used iron rods to hold the different panes of glass in place. From the 1300s onwards, glassmakers began to use silver stain, a product made with silver nitrate which gave a yellow effect. In the late medieval period, Cousin’s Rose stain was used to enhance flesh tones.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_moot_hill_long	In order to effectively delegate extensive jurisdiction over large areas of land in early medieval societies, congregation places were needed where those with recognised legal rights could gather and dispense law. Thought to be originally used by the Saxons as a kind of ancient Germanic general assembly, a moot hill, or ‘mons placiti’, was a particular type of congregation place that often – but not always – took the form of an actual hill, or some other naturally occurring feature. It was in these places that local people settled their business as well as being where proclamations were read, and most importantly, where many court cases were argued and decided upon. The use of hills likely came from the presence of burial mounds near most settlement areas where people lived in larger groups, as these places were seen as sacred or hallow ground, but other locations would have been purpose-built.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_port_herring_long	Fish bone evidence gathered from around the Scottish coast indicates that marine-based subsistence quadrupled there in the early Middle Ages, coinciding with the time of increased Viking settlement in the 8th century. Herring was one of the most common catches of the era for the new settlers, and had been a valuable maritime resource to the Gaels and Picts who were already inhabiting the area before their arrival. The beauty of herring was that it could be gathered easily, simply by casting off in a small boat and scooping large shoals directly out of coastal waters. This process was done on a much larger scale as human populations increased, especially considering the impact of the swelling inland communities on freshwater ecosystems of river fish. The Vikings likely imported their own superior fishing techniques to cultivate the plentiful herring, such as the use of different forms of driftnets and foreshore weirs to trap them with the outgoing tides, thus contributing to the flourishing herring markets of the era.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tithe_hall_long	Originally expounded in ecclesiastical law, tithing was the debt of lay people to make obligatory contributions of money or supplies to the church. Although such systems started out as religious charters in biblical times, by the 8th century they had started to be enforced in many places within Europe by secular laws. The main purpose for tithing systems was to support the clergy, maintain churches, assist the poor, and provide subsidy to construct many of the grand buildings associated with religious worship like cathedrals. Although tithe contributions were sometimes made in the form of monetary payments, agricultural societies like Britain in the Middle Ages often paid the equivalent in crop yields, farm stock, or other consumable goods. Tithe barns, where such contributions were stored, were often sizeable buildings – all farms and manorial systems under the tithing laws of a land had to contribute, so there was a lot of supplies to have to store.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_farm_long	Farming not only dictated the daily roles of the individuals who had made their home on the British Isles in the early Middle Ages, but also defined the passage of time for them in terms of the agricultural seasons through which they lived. The eighth-century historian Bede painted a picture of fertile lands of variety and abundance, that had long been farmed by myriad settlers throughout the ages. Farming space, or lack of it in the Scandinavian context, is thought to be one of the motivations for Viking migration to Britain, as it was known that there was an increasing population in areas such as Jutland and Norway at the time. Some historical records also mention a type of lottery practiced by the Northmen thought to have been intended to help prevent excessive strain on agriculture in their homelands due to overcrowding, with the losers exiled to find a new life of subsistence abroad.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_mill_long	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electricity, harnessing the natural strength of water was an extremely effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were first used in ancient Rome and India, and by the end of the 10th century there were several thousand mills harnessing the power of water across Europe. Using the power of streams or rivers by catching heads of water in paddles, watermills transform kinetic energy into rotational energy at a gearhouse. This, in turn, works the pestle and mortar mechanisms used to grind and mash grain. The basic principle of watermills has never changed, though the machinery itself differed depending on where they were built – for instance, 'tide mills' at coastal settlements employed the same method of energy generation, but used the rising and falling motion of the tides to power their mechanisms.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_offas_hall_long	King Offa was one of the most renowned kings of the Anglo-Saxon era. He ruled over Mercia in the second half of the 8th century and famously brought a large part of England south of Yorkshire under the highest level of Saxon political unification ever seen. An expansionist ruler, Offa clashed with the Saxons of Wessex during his efforts to ruthlessly suppress resistance from anyone who opposed his single, powerful Mercian state. He was less concerned with uniting the people of the Anglo-Saxon cultural sphere, and more motivated by the protection and expansion of his own kingdom. His protectionist efforts are famously represented by the remnants of Offa’s Dyke, the great linear earthwork constructed to defend his kingdom from the Welsh groups to the west. Offa’s aspirations for power, however, were more lavishly symbolised by the coinage on which he appeared, as well as the Great Hall in Tamworth from which he ruled – a grand structure built as an improvement on the royal hall of King Creoda, the fabled inaugural ruler of Mercia thought to have lived around two hundred years earlier.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_iron_long	Iron’s versatility and availability made it very popular throughout the ancient and medieval worlds. By the end of the bronze age, many uses had been found for copper alloys, but with the discovery of iron smelting processes, a whole new range of products started to be manufactured. It is one of the most common elements on earth and used to create steel, one of the hardest substances on earth, simply by adding carbon impurities to it. Historically, the incredible durability of steel made iron a vital ingredient for the production of tools and weapons, driving war and industry throughout the past in many parts of the world. In the context of the British Isles, iron weaponry and armour were likely treasured by the warriors of the early medieval period, with martial artefacts commonly passed between generations, and some grave-finds identified as having been circulated for a century or more before being buried with their final owners.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_rock_caisil_long	The Rock of Caisil is a curious landmark – a seemingly out-of-place limestone hill mysteriously situated on the flatlands of Tipperary, Ireland, upon which ancient fortresses and castles stood at various points throughout history. The site is associated with Saint Patrick, who was said to have banished Satan himself from a mountain cave located 30 kilometres away resulting in the furious demon biting off a piece of the mountain, breaking a tooth, and spitting the rock out to its resting place in Tipperary. In reality the hill probably existed before Saint Patrick’s time, since history also relates that the ruling Eóganacht dynasty of Munster constructed a stronghold upon it as early as the 4th century. This probably gave the location its name, since ‘Caisil’ in Old Gaelic translates to ‘stone fort’. Demon-banishing legends aside, the rock is also known to be where Saint Patrick converted and christened the 'King of Munster' at the time in around AD 450, a key event in the spreading of Christianity in Ireland. From the conversion of this dynasty there, the hill site remained an important power base in the following centuries, acting as the king's seat up until the Norman invasion.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tin_long	Tin is a key ingredient of bronze, and despite the bronze age having long been over by the beginning of the Christian era, bronze’s resistance to rust compared to ferrous metals meant it always remained an important and valuable material with a multitude of applications. Due to the rarity of tin in Europe, wherever streams were present it was always very profitable for those who controlled them. In fact, abundant tin deposits are thought to be the reason why Cornwall and Devon suffered successive invasions in late antiquity and later centuries. The Romans, for example, initially occupied areas of mainland Britain further east, with tin production almost certainly the main reason why they ventured into the southwestern Celtic kingdom of Dumnonia at the time. Centuries later, as the region was dominating the European market for the resource, control of its output was thought to be the motive for the eventual Anglo-Saxon expansion into the area.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_salt_long	Salt was vitally important for its use in the preservation of fish and meat throughout the medieval period, when it was mostly obtained from salt pans in coastal areas and royally designated ‘salt districts’. Early records highlight the significance of saltworks to Anglo-Saxon kings, with the 11th century Domesday book listing up to 285 salt pans in Sussex alone. Royal charters from before that time already mention salt production as an important function for some royal estates, where kings of the era were known to have made provisions for the appropriate facilities wherever the resource was available. The Vikings, known to have been quite fond of meat, were undoubtedly also familiar with food preservation techniques, but may have used curdled milk as a preservative rather than salt. With Britain’s extensive history in salt production, however, they likely switched to salt-curing processes to take advantage of the more effective local resource of their newly-settled land.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_mint_long	The increase in power centralisation in early medieval England inevitably meant that rulers gained a wider reach to administer and intervene in the daily life of the ruled. This was exemplified not only in the creation of towns during the period, but also the production and use of coinage. Legitimised, emblazoned wealth with clearly definable value was useful for many reasons, enabling kings to draw income from several sources from across his lands – things like tributes, tolls, fines, and forfeitures incurred in the law courts, with paid coinage typically presided over by royal reeves. By the end of the 9th century, there were a few mints located in the most secure royal centres in Britain. The most astute rulers divided their royal income into fractions earmarked for special purposes, an undertaking which would have been impossible without coinage systems run by educated men.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_master_forge_long	As the economy of Anglo-Saxon England experienced changes and advancements between the late 7th and mid-9th centuries, the Mercian kings demonstrated a notable ability to harness the various sources of wealth in the land to increase their own power. Such wealth is perhaps no more evident anywhere else as in the findings observed in the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found. The artefacts date back to the seventh or eighth century, with their location placing them right in the period of the Kingdom of Mercia. Although metalworking had a pragmatic place in Anglo-Saxon society, the findings in the hoard are almost exclusively martial in character, with a notably high level of workmanship. For the Mercians, weaponry was clearly used symbolically as well as practically – an indication of status both on and off the battlefield. As such, Mercian weapons would have partly been the product of the blacksmith, and partly that of the goldsmith or jeweller.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_round_tower_long	During the Dark Ages, many tall, round-tower structures were constructed in northern parts of the British Isles and Ireland. Known as ‘brochs’ in Scotland, and ‘cloigtheach’ in Ireland, the reasons for their construction are not always clear, but their names give clues as to their purpose. ‘Broch’ has its roots in the word ‘brough’, a lowland word for fort and similar in meaning to the Germanic ‘burg’ and ‘borough’, while ‘Cloigtheach’ means ‘bell house’. This, along with the clusters of village buildings at their feet, indicates that these towers were intended for both defensive and public order purposes. With some towers being up to forty metres high, they enabled a 360-degree view of the surrounding land and therefore any approaching forces, with entrance doors that were usually several feet up and accessible with a ladder which could be raised or lowered, or postholes into which wooden steps could be inserted for the same purpose. Rooms within the towers were generally positioned inside a second wall, with stairs between the two to give access to the upper levels. This made them very secure and therefore a likely place to keep valuables safe from marauding raiders.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_nunnaminster_long	Although the war with the Vikings had taken much out of King Alfred and his West Saxon kingdom, the venerable monarch was tireless in his efforts to set about restoring society by promoting learning, order, and peace within his kingdom. Part of those efforts was his reinstitution of the church’s influence and importance, and he did so by setting up two new religious houses in Winchester – a new monastery for monks known as New Minster, and an abbey for nuns known as the nun’s minster or ‘Nunnaminster’. Ran under Benedictine rule, it was closely connected to the royal household and was one of the foremost centres of learning and art in southern England of the Dark Ages. In its original form, the nunnery was a double-domed wooden structure that was eventually rebuilt in stone like other religious buildings of its type in the era. It sat in isolation from the growing city of Winchester within a single enclosure that covered an extensive area, also containing the newly-built New Minster, as well as the older Anglo-Saxon cathedral known as Old Minster.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_scoan_abbey_long	Old Scone was one of the noteworthy ancient capitals of the Pictish kingdoms, the rulers of which presided over the constantly shifting dominions of the north. With the spread of Christianity in the Dark Ages, Scone became a notable location for the early Christian church in Scotland. It was there that an Augustinian monastery known as Scone Priory was founded, which eventually became an Abbot’s residence, and later on encompassed the grounds of the chief residence of Scottish kings, Scone Palace. For many years before it housed royalty, however, the abbey at Scone had been an important venue. It stood opposite an old Moot Hill that acted as a famous coronation site of numerous ancient kings, and at one point was home to the mysterious ‘Stone of Destiny’, a holy relic also known as ‘The Stone of Scone’. A pale rectangular block of sandstone weighing around 152kg, Scottish kings would sit on it during coronation ceremonies as part of an old tradition practiced in Ireland and Scotland since ancient times. The Stone of Destiny was used to enthrone Scottish monarchs at Iona and Dunadd before being used at Scone, and is considered a powerful living symbol of Scottish nationalism.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_court_school_long	By the time of King Alfred the Great’s treaty with Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, the war had already taken much out of Alfred’s West Saxon kingdom. Even so, the venerable monarch was nevertheless tireless in his efforts to set about restoring society by promoting learning, order, and peace within his kingdom. For Alfred, the greatest failing of his peoples was their laziness in pursuing wisdom and promoting education, so to address this perceived problem he gathered court scholars from around Britain and the continent to revive learning in his kingdom. Central to his reforms was the idea that education was not just an obligation for the clergy or monks, as was the case at the time, but for all those who served in his court. Convinced that the exercising of power had to have the precondition of wisdom, he cajoled and threatened his nobles with dismissal if they did not learn how to read – an extraordinary demand in a time when most men had likely been illiterate since childhood. Almost immediately, his ealdormen and thegns did as he requested, such was their unwillingness to otherwise relinquish their offices of power.	true

building_description_texts_long_description_vik_port_fish_long	The effectiveness of early ship development of the various groups vying for power in Viking-era Britain arguably shaped its destiny. Even before King Alfred’s foundation of what is considered the first large-scale royal navy in the 9th century, the inhabitants of the Isles would have long been able seafarers for the purposes of commerce, fishing, and faster travel. As with other areas of innovation, ship designs often took on external influences out of necessity, but that was not the case for everyone. For example, the Saxons were originally settlers from across the sea themselves so had their own techniques, while the Vikings were defined by their superior abilities in shipbuilding from their need to cross vast oceans, sail up rivers, and carry out swift coastal raids. In all cases, however, facilities would always be needed to safely load and unload ships, whether the cargo was tradeable goods, warriors, or just normal travelling folk.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_great_hall_long	By the post-Roman era, most communities on the British Isles had moved away from the tribal hierarchies seen in past centuries and started to be ruled over by fully-fledged kingdoms. Tribal hall buildings remained important meeting places, however, acting as effective arms of governance and dispensation of justice. They were also the assembly places for groups like guilds, religious orders, and ‘tithings’, that is, groups of kinsmen or unrelated freemen who acted as sureties for one another's behaviour. Saxon and Viking poetry often alludes to the ‘joys of the hall’, a clear reference to the feasting and drinking that often took place before or after battles. This also served a quasi-political purpose, as successful kings did not only attract men to their service solely by being courageous warriors or effective rulers – the faithful would share in their leaders’ revelries in return for being eternally prepared to fight and die for them in times of war.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_hof_long	"Thorgrim Helgason had a large temple built in his hayfield…. Everybody had to pay a temple fee. Thor was the god most honoured there. It was rounded on the inside, like a vault, and there were windows and wall-hangings everywhere. The image of Thor stood in the center, with other gods on both sides. In front of them was an altar made with great skill and covered with iron on the top. On this there was to be a fire which would never go out—they called it sacred fire. On the altar was to lie a great armband, made of silver. The temple godi was to wear it on his arm at all gatherings, and everyone was to swear oaths on it whenever a suit was brought. A great copper bowl was to stand on the altar, and into it was to go all the blood which came from animals or men given to Thor. They called this sacrificial blood [hlaut] and the sacrificial blood bowl [hlautbolli]. This blood was to be sprinkled over men and animals, and the animals that were given in sacrifice were to be used for feasting when sacrificial banquets were held. Men whom they sacrificed were to be cast into a pool which was outside by the door; they called it Blótkelda (Well of Sacrifice).	true

building_description_texts_long_description_vik_athletics_long	9th and 10th century Irish armies were often supported by non-warriors and youths who, being without normal weaponry, would support their fellow tribe member by pelting the enemy battle line with rocks, light javelins, and whatever else would come to hand. These chaps would be next to useless in a stand up fight but are ideal for causing a steady drip of casualties before the main units charge in. It would be a dreadful mistake, however, to discount the intense killing power a barrage of stones and missiles can inflict on the enemy. Many wars have been won simply by utilising ‘harass and retreat’ tactics over an extended period of time to deny the enemy their objective.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_oxford_long	As the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is a unique and historic institution. It was agreed for many centuries that King Alfred was personally responsible for founding the school in 872 AD after a scholarly debate with monks that lasted several days, though there is no real reason to believe this myth. Coins have been found from the reign of King Alfred which bear the mark "Ohsnafordia", which may indicate the presence of a royal mint at Oxford. In reality, it grew up in the 12th century when famous teachers began to lecture there and groups of students came to live and study in Oxford. The university was given a boost in 1167 when, for political reasons, Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris and forced many of them to come home. 	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_island_monastery_long	In the 7th century, King Oswald, arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon warlord in Britain in his day, gifted the Island of Lindisfarne to the monks from Iona, thereby enabling them to establish a monastery and a bishopric in the political heart of the Northumbrian kingdom. Miracles were reported at St Cuthbert’s shrine, the monastery's most venerated Saint, and Lindisfarne was quickly established as a major pilgrimage and centre of Christian learning in Northumbria. As a result, the monastery grew in power and wealth, attracting grants of land from kings and nobles as well as gifts of money and precious objects. On 793 AD Lindisfarne suffered a devastating raid by Viking pirates – their first significant attack in Western Europe. The raid was physically and psychologically devastating to all Christians, even on the Continent - one of England’s holiest shrines had been attacked by pagans, and St Cuthbert had not intervened to stop them.	true
